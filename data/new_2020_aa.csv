20200093870001,Building Futures Literacy in Africa: design phase,BUILDING FUTURES LITERACY IN AFRICA: DESIGN PHASE,"In an increasingly complex world, it is important for communities to build the capacities to imagine and design their own futures. This project will support the design phase of an initiative that will strengthen and expand the use of the interdisciplinary futures literacy approach, which encompasses a range of innovative techniques to foresee possible futures and enable planners to develop anticipatory responses. This project will involve building Futures Literacy Laboratories in low-income countries in southern and eastern Africa. It is anticipated that this would position Futures Literacy as a tool to enhance social and economic development and social inclusion and peace, and to contribute to stronger theoretical foundations for foresight and anticipatory systems.",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.0309866610914469

USAID is working in partnership with the United Nations Office for REDD+ Coordination in Indonesia (UNORCID). The project will work to reduce the number of burning fires, or 'hotspots', and consequently, reduced haze impacts and greenhouse gas emissions from those areas. The project will use the Sustainable Landscapes indicators on GHG reductions, as well as increased number of institutions with improved capacity to reduce emission.~",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Review,0.000519678229466081
