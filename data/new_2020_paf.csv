20190090760002,Improving Agricultural Productivity and Resilience with Satellite and Cellphone Imagery to Scale Climate-Smart Crop Insurance (Cultiaf-2),IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND RESILIENCE WITH SATELLITE AND CELLPHONE IMAGERY TO SCALE CLIMATE-SMART CROP INSURANCE (CULTIAF-2),"The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.  This project is funded through the second phase of the Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF-2), a joint program of IDRC and the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

2020007737,Theory of Change Observatory on Disaster Resilience,THEORY OF CHANGE OBSERVATORY ON DISASTER RESILIENCE,"Humanitarian disasters such as droughts expose approximately 10 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa to food, water and energy insecurity. Besides the humanitarian consequences disasters such as floods also heighten investment risks due to creation of 'stranded assets' such as wastewater treatment plants in developing countries. Global climate models can be used to identify the geographical distribution of disaster risk but without being able to specify the regional intensity, frequency and duration of events. In Sub-Saharan Africa the difference between what models forecast and the reality of dryness has come to be known as the 'East Africa Climate paradox'. Because of model inconsistency, it is difficult for investors and decision makers to be forewarned about impending events and to respond when they occur. Two recent policy trends have however converged to enhance the potential for Cyber-enabled Effective Disaster Response: (a) the expansion of Regional Early Warning Systems (REWS) and (b) a growing demand for open data platforms to enhance accountability of decision-making processes. For instance, the Africa Data Consensus (ADC) resolved to emphasize the role of open data networks to support coherent decision making through better organization of data and models. From a scientific standpoint Agent Based Modelling has also begun to advocate more forcefully for engagement of stakeholders to develop and calibrate models. In this regard, our prior research to pilot-test the Wastewater Reuse Effectiveness Index (WREI) for Sustainable Development Goal 6.3 revealed the potential of down-scaled models to advance circular economy pathways, such as wastewater recycling with potential to mitigate disaster risk. The overall aim of the Theory of change Observatory project will therefore be to enhance regional capacity to develop, pilot-test and validate regional climate models that enables the prediction, assessment and response to effects of droughts and flood risk by: (Obj 1) Developing a place-based observatory based on principles of dispersed data handling and reuse (Work Package (WP) 1,4), (Obj 2) Co-curating and co-designing regional research that focuses on down-scaling and coupling robust models of disaster risk monitoring (WP2,3), and (Obj 3) Pilot-testing and validating composite indices as a means of knowledge translation with the objective of building a theory of change on disaster resilience (WP5).",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.998995840549469

Des décennies de chocs successifs ont intensifié les besoins humanitaires et la vulnérabilité de la population. Celle-ci doit faire face aux conséquences des violences et conflits, ainsi qu'à des épidémies récurrentes, engendrant malnutrition et insécurité alimentaire. 7,5 millions de Congolais, dont 1,6 million de personnes déplacées, ont besoin d'une aide humanitaire d'urgence en 2016, principalement dans le nord et l'Est du pays. Les territoires de Lisala et Lolo, visés par le programme proposé, ont une pluviométrie importante de par leur position géographique (zone équatoriale) et subissent fréquemment les phénomènes d'érosion et d'inondations. Les effets de ces phénomènes naturels accentuent davantage la vulnérabilité des populations, en particulier celles qui se trouvent en milieu rural. Les inondations du dernier trimestre de 2015 ont touché environ 500.000 personnes dans le bassin du fleuve Congo, dont la province de la Mongala qui comprend Lisala et Lolo. - General Purpose: RDC : Augmenter la résilience des populations vulnérables par le renforcement de leurs capacités en matière de préparation et d'atténuation de l'impact des risques des catastrophes.  - Specific Purpose : Renforcer la capacité des communautés locales à limiter les impacts négatifs des inondations et des érosions sur les populations et leur milieu de vie. - Results:  R1 : Le système de veille sur les chocs-aléas climatiques mis en place dans les communautés locales est outillé et fonctionnel.R2 : Les communautés locales développent et prennent des mesures pour gérer et réduire les effets des inondations et des érosions dans leur milieu de vie.R3 : Les sources d'alimentation et de revenu des ménages accompagnés sont diversifiées et protégées contre les aléas climatiques grâce à l'adaptation du système d'exploitation agricole et de pêche.",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Review,0.368122905492783

It must be noted that the ZRBF, with gender equality at the heart of its programming will aim to target a minimum of 400 000 women in its programming.The expected results for the ZRBF, with the funding available as per 2015, is to enhance food security and livelihood diversification strategies of targeted communities that increase resilience to recurrent stresses/shocks. More specifically the ZRBF is expected to: • Increase effective evidence based institutional, legislative and policy frameworks in place at national and sub-national levels for resilience • Increase the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities to face shocks and the effects of climate change for approximately 800,000 people in vulnerable communities frequently exposed to multiple hazards in a total of estimated 20 of Zimbabwe's 59 rural districts. • Improved protection of household and community assets and decrease in annual economic losses due to effects of hazards and climate change • A crisis modifier that can provide early warning and early action to reduce the impact of climate induced shocks in place for the Fund. (With the new planned budget allocation, a substantial increase in the target number of beneficiaries is estimated. While it is planned that 10-25% of programmable funds will be allocated to this result area, final beneficiaries number will be subject to further needs assessment and also based on the nature of the shocks/crises and scope of the planned response.)",Rural development,Review,0.0198608189821243
2020006744,Open Network for WAter-Related Diseases (ONWARD),OPEN NETWORK FOR WATER-RELATED DISEASES (ONWARD),"The ONWARD Network (Open Network for Water-Related Diseases) is dedicated to forecasting, early warning & risk mapping for water-associated diseases through use of remote sensing, field observations & mathematical modelling. Our vision is to enable cost-effective, regularly updated, geo-referenced early warning for areas vulnerable to water-associated diseases, which in turn will enable preventive measures to be deployed in a timely manner to minimise the probability of epidemics. Our long-term vision is to establish a system that will be applicable broadly, in a variety of localities & for a variety of diseases. By 'water-associated' disease, we mean a rather broad class, including diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera, skin diseases associated with water-borne bacteria or metazoan parasites, vector-borne diseases such as malaria & dengue fever, & others such as hepatitis. The 'water' involved may be fresh, or brackish or coastal seawater. The network will respond primarily the GCRF Challenge of Global Health (infectious diseases), & secondarily to that of Resilience to Environmental Shocks & Change (since outbreaks of water-associated diseases are affected by extreme weather events, expected to become more frequent as a result of climate change). The network will also address UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, Target 3d, to 'Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction & management of national & global health risks.' According to the World Health Organisation, some two billion people use faecally-contaminated drinking water, putting them at risk of death or chronic poor health from water-borne infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid & polio. Provision of safe drinking water is hostage to the influence of extreme weather & flooding. Apart from the fatalities, the effect of a chronic burden of lower-level infection by water-associated diseases is antagonistic to the maintenance of a healthy work force & to the well-being of society in general, to the detriment of sustainable development. For example, cholera kills an estimated 95,000 people every year, but it also makes another 2.9 million seriously ill with a debilitating disease. Hence the need to address, in addition, the resilience of communities to perturbations of the safe drinking water supply under extreme weather events associated with a changing climate. Before now, our ability to develop early warning, risk reduction & management of national & global health risks due to water-associated diseases has been limited by mutual isolation of the scientific communities whose collective effort is required to make progress. Forecasting outbreaks of water-associated diseases & their geo-referenced risk mapping is a complex matter for which the collaboration of experts from several disciplines (ranging from environmental biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, social sciences & epidemiology to remote sensing & mode",Education policy and administrative management,Review,0.0168373193591833

Il s'agit à la fois d'une crise de santé publique et d'une crise humanitaire qui a des répercussions sur la vie, la santé et les moyens de subsistance des populations du monde entier. L'impact potentiel du COVID-19 sur les personnes les plus vulnérables du monde, déjà touchées par les déplacements, les conflits, les catastrophes naturelles et le changement climatique, en fait la menace actuelle la plus urgente.Le 26 mars dernier, la FICR a lancé un appel de 550 millions CHF pour soutenir les Sociétés nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (ci-après, SN) dans les domaines des soins de santé, du prépositionnement des marchandises, de la communication des risques, des enseignements tirés du réseau mondial d'intervenants locaux, des transferts monétaires pour les familles et de l'atténuation des effets des grandes épidémies. Sur les 550 millions CHF, 150 millions sont destinés à la FICR pour soutenir les SN dans le besoin, tandis que les 400 millions restants seront collectés par les SN au niveau national. L'intervention de la FICR proposée pour un financement belge s'inscrit dans les 150 millions CHF recherchés par la FICR dans son appel d'urgence – épidémie COVID-19 (« IFRC Revised Emergency Appeal MDR00005: COVID-19 outbreak », annexe 2b). A noter que déjà le 31 janvier dernier, la FICR avait lancé un appel d'urgence – épidémie COVID-19 qui recherchait 3 millions CHF. Vu l'ampleur de la crise, cet appel a été révisé et relancé le 26 mars avec une nouvelle planification et un nouveau montant de 150 millions CHF. Le DREF, fonds flexible de la FICR que la Belgique finance en 2020 avec 1,5 millions EUR, a déjà permis de soutenir l'appel d'urgence de la FICR avec 1 million CHF. La FICR et ses 192 SN sont solidaires envers les personnes affectées par la crise COVID-19 et en première ligne des réponses communautaires à cette pandémie dans le monde entier. Avec plus de 160.000 bureaux locaux et plus de 13 millions de volontaires et de collaborateurs de confiance, la FICR et les SN sont particulièrement bien placées pour aider les personnes et leurs communautés à se préparer et à répondre à cette urgence mondiale. Combinant l'expertise d'acteurs sanitaires et humanitaires qui travaillent dans leurs propres communautés, la FICR et ses membres offrent une perspective et des outils mondiaux, associés à une présence locale et une réponse nationale dans toutes les régions du monde. Les SN, dans leur rôle d'auxiliaires des pouvoirs publics, s'engagent auprès de leurs gouvernements sur la manière de soutenir et de compléter au mieux les plans d'action nationaux, et de remplir leur mandat.

Additionally, significant national health determinants, such as water and sanitation systems and food production systems, may yet be further adversely impacted by climate variability and change. -- These vulnerabilities, combined with the poor adaptive capacity in underfunded key institutions and health programs, and lack of investments in training and advanced technology are manifest in current poor national health outcomes, which are expected to decline even more under future projected climate changes. -- The current project aims at strengthening the climate resilience of Mozambique's National Health System, in order to allow it to prepare, cope with and manage the health risks posed by climate variability and change, in a way that the essential functions of health systems are less vulnerable to climate and that facilitates sustained improvements in population health outcomes, despite an unstable climate. -- This project works on three tiers aiming to1) Improve governance, institutional and human capacity2) Strengthen existing climate sensitive disease surveillance systems, and scientific evidence on health impacts from climate change3) Build the resilience of specific health policies, strategies, programmes and plans - Specific Purpose : Among the expected outputs the project will: -- 1) Strengthen the national plan for Health Adaptation to Climate Change to ensure better governance of health adaptation.  -- 2) Establish health sector internal and external coordination mechanism to combat climate change impact to ensure maximum benefit from joint action.  -- 3) Include climate risks in core health education programs to ensure sustainable capacity building. -- 4) Mainstreams climate risk management into the National Disease Control Programs, and Health Promotion strategy and relevant health policies. -- 5) Set national research priorities to inform decisions and increase national research capacity. -- 6) Strengthen climate sensitive disease information systems.  -- 7) Develop tools for health national health authorities to manage climate risks to health (e.g. integrated risk monitoring systems to monitor climate risks to health, early warning systems, health seasonal outlooks). -- 8) Increase national communication on climate risks to health -- 9) Improve preparedness and response to climate extreme events.",Health policy and administrative management,Review,0.00412285421043634

Environ 1,9 million de personnes sont déplacées à l'intérieur du Soudan et près de 1,1 million de réfugiés, demandeurs d'asile et migrants de la République centrafricaine, du Tchad, de l'Érythrée, de l'Éthiopie, du Soudan du Sud et de la Syrie sont présents dans le pays. On estime que 6,2 millions de personnes sont actuellement en situation de grave insécurité alimentaire, ce qui aggrave des niveaux de malnutrition déjà élevés. Des épidémies de maladies transmissibles ont mis à rude épreuve un système de santé déjà surchargé.  Avec le soutien d'AMC, le Bureau de la coordination des affaires humanitaires gère le Fonds humanitaire pour le Soudan afin de fournir des allocations en temps opportun aux ONG nationales et internationales et aux agences des Nations Unies, pour répondre aux besoins humanitaires criants des populations dans tout le pays. Le soutien apporté au Fonds contribue à la réalisation de ses objectifs, notamment : 1) promouvoir une action et une intervention rapides pour réduire les pertes de vies humaines, 2) améliorer la réponse aux besoins humanitaires pressants, 3) renforcer les éléments essentiels de l'intervention humanitaire dans les crises sous-financées.",Material relief assistance and services,Review,0.00392134068533778

L'intervention de la Croix-Rouge de RDC (CRRDC), appuyée par la Croix-Rouge de Belgique (CRB) s'articule autour de trois volets d'activités sur base des besoins identifiés par les communautés : - La préparation et la réponse aux risques de catastrophes naturelles à travers la mise en place d'équipes communautaires capables d'accompagner les bénéficiaires dans l'identification des risques, lors de la réalisation de plans de contingence pour agir une fois que le risque se produit et dans la mise en place d'infrastructures telles que des bassins de rétention d'eau permettant de sécuriser certaines habitations lors des fortes pluies. - Le renforcement de l'accès à la santé des communautés, en particulier des femmes, à travers des activités de sensibilisations réalisées par des équipes communautaires ou par des  Clubs des mères  qui mènent des actions visant l'amélioration des connaissances des femmes sur leur santé, notamment reproductive. Les frais liés à ces activités sont couverts par des activités génératrices de revenus mises en œuvre par les ''Clubs de mères''. - L'amélioration de l'accès à l'eau potable et de l'assainissement à travers la réalisation ou réhabilitation de points d'eau potable et la promotion de l'auto-construction de latrines hygiéniques. Les Clubs des mères organiseront de l'appui-conseil individuel au sein des foyers des femmes vulnérables sur les thématiques de l'eau, l'hygiène et l'assainissement. Pour garantir la durabilité du programme, les cadres de la Croix-Rouge de RDC, les équipes décentralisées, les volontaires et les communautés bénéficiaires seront renforcées dans leurs capacités.",Health education,Review,0.00379572459496558

Les besoins humanitaires sont importants: environ 1,1 million de personnes ont besoin de protection et d'une assistance humanitaire immédiate, en ce compris un accès urgent aux services essentiels de base et à des moyens de subsistance. La détérioration des conditions socio-économiques, la réduction de l'accès aux services de base ainsi que les inondations localisées, ont créé de nouveaux besoins humanitaires et menacent davantage la sécurité et la dignité des personnes les plus vulnérables, en particulier les jeunes, les femmes et les enfants.La zone d'intervention proposée concerne 2 communes (Gitanga et Bukemba) de la province de Rutana, frontalière avec la Tanzanie.C'est l'une des provinces d'origine des nouveaux réfugiés burundais en Tanzanie, et elle accueille quelques milliers de déplacés internes en provenance d'autres provinces. Ces deux communes ont été touchées par des pluies diluviennes liées au phénomène El-Nino, en décembre 2015 et février 2016. Les conséquences de ces perturbations climatiques ont été accentuées par la déforestation dûe au manque de mécanismes de lutte antiérosive et de protection des sols, ainsi qu'à l'absence de préparation aux catastrophes au niveau local, ce qui a conduit à la destruction de cultures et d'infrastructures. La crise socio-politique que traverse le Burundi depuis mai 2015, ainsi que ces pluies dévastatrices, sont des facteurs aggravants de l'insécurité alimentaire chronique dans laquelle vivent les populations depuis de nombreuses années. - General Purpose: Burundi : Augmenter la résilience des populations vulnérables des Bassins-Versants de la rivière Musasa dans la Province de Rutana face aux risques de catastrophes. - Specific Purpose : Renforcer les capacités communautaires dans les communes de Bukemba et Gitanga en matière de préparation et d'atténuation aux risques de catastrophes  - Results:  I.Burundi :R1 : Les capacités communautaires à prévenir les catastrophes et à s'y préparer sont augmentéesR2 : Les capacités de résilience des populations à risque sont durablement améliorées grâce à la gestion durable de l'environnement et de leur facteur de production 'sol' ainsi qu'à la diversification de leurs sources alimentaires et de revenusR3 : Des emplois ponctuels décents, à parité en genre, permettant aux victimes des catastrophes récentes de compenser temporairement la perte de leurs moyens d'existence, sont créés dans le cadre de la réhabilitation des infrastructures prioritaires récemment détruites et concourent à améliorer / rétablir la protection des populations (accès aux services de base – santé, éducation etc.)II.Niger : R1 : les ménages et les communautés sont mieux préparés pour faire face aux chocs et à limiter les situations d'urgence qui en découlentR2: les ménages et les communautés améliorent leur gestion des re",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Review,0.00359280011616647

Les crises alimentaires consécutives, l'extrême pauvreté, les déplacements de population et la rapide croissance démographique continuent d'éroder la résilience de la population. La situation s'est encore dégradée après février 2015, en raison des débordements du conflit au Nigéria et de l'augmentation du nombre de déplacés et de réfugiés dans la région de Diffa. On estime que 2,7 millions de personnes sont en situation d'insécurité alimentaire sévère et ont besoin d'une aide alimentaire d'urgence pour traverser la période de transition cette année. La région de Diffa est régulièrement sujette à des aléas climatiques, comme la sécheresse et les inondations, mais doit également faire face à un manque d'eau potable ainsi qu'à une situation sécuritaire préoccupante qui provoque d'importants déplacements de population depuis 2013. L'accumulations de ces catastrophes d'origines diverses, provoquent des pertes matérielles (récoltes ou stocks de vivres), la dégradation des conditions socio-économiques des populations et ont des conséquences désastreuses sur la situation sanitaire et alimentaire des habitants (épidémies, malnutrition, etc.). Depuis 2012, la région de Diffa accueille des déplacés du Nigeria qui fuient les multiples attaques de la secte Boko Haram, essentiellement dans sa partie Nord. Les réfugiés, retournés et déplacés internes s'élèvent actuellement à plus de 100.000 personnes et 460.000 personnes sont en insécurité alimentaire. - General Purpose: Niger : Augmenter la résilience des populations vulnérables par le renforcement de leurs capacités en matière de préparation et d'atténuation de l'impact des catastrophes.  - Specific Purpose : Renforcer les capacités des populations vulnérables à limiter les impacts négatifs de la sécheresse et des déplacements de population dus aux exactions de Boko Haram - Results:  R1 : les ménages et les communautés sont mieux préparés pour faire face aux chocs et à limiter les situations d'urgence qui en découlentR2: les ménages et les communautés améliorent leur gestion des ressources en eau via un meilleur accès et une meilleure utilisation de l'eau potableR3: les ménages vulnérables et les jeunes sans emploi (vulnérables à Boko Haram) restaurent leurs moyens d'existence grâce au maraîchage, aux AGR et au développement de l'entreprenariatR4 : les jeunes sont sensibilisés et engagés à soutenir la gestion des conflits et l'édification de la paix",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Review,0.00335605535656214

It will do so by using a transdisciplinary research approach aimed at empowering residents of disaster-prone urban poor neighbourhoods, which will underpin the co-production of enhanced, context-specific understandings of local risks and the integration of the resulting data into decision-making procedures in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development monitoring.   The project is conducted by a highly skilled multi-disciplinary research team (including social sciences, engineering and physical sciences) and adopts a dialogic co-production approach to citizen-generated data which relies upon well-established partnerships with community-based initiatives for local development, education and disaster risk reduction in Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, as well as with governmental agencies involved in disaster risk reduction and local planning and development.  URBE Latam proceeds in four integrated components that seek an enhanced understanding of risks, vulnerabilities and local capabilities in disaster-prone urban areas: first it is centred on the engagement of citizens to generate data to expand understandings of risks at the neighbourhood level, second, citizens engagement in risk will be pursued alongside an analysis of socio-spatial inequalities in resilience and development indicators and policies at city and national level, third, this will lead to the recalibration of environmental risk mapping with citizen-generated data, fourth, these components are articulated and integrated within a framework to facilitate dialogic transformations across the different levels and stakeholders involved.  The process of advancing these outputs will further enable capacity development in local communities and the governments of Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, a process which will be augmented by improving the awareness of stakeholders in other Latin American cities and countries through broader dissemination.  Insights from collaboratively produced citizen-generated data will be integrated into the practices of disaster risk management and development monitoring (e.g. SDG reporting) in collaboration with international policymaking agencies, thus enabling transformations towards more equitable disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. As an overarching outcome, the project will enable the transformation of practices, improve knowledge among a diverse range of stakeholders and enhance capacity to promote equitable resilience.",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.000577683618757874

The densely populated Afghan-Tajik basin and its margins differ on seismic activity - low activity in the basin contrasts concentrated activity along the margins. The so-called Tajik-Afghan belt of danger marks the study area of this project proposal. We will localise fault zones along which earthquakes are likely to occur. We will describe their deformation history and kinematics, and reconstruct their past tension fields in order to evaluate the shear stresses along the fault zones and whether the tension fields have changed during the last 10 Ma. We will create a mass wasting inventory to relate the magnitude and frequency of such events with potentially active faults, the geology, and relief. - Research funding with particular importance for the developing country on earthquake / tsunami prevention",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Review,0.000264974776655436
