Improving Agricultural Productivity and Resilience with Satellite and Cellphone Imagery to Scale Climate-Smart Crop Insurance (Cultiaf-2),IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND RESILIENCE WITH SATELLITE AND CELLPHONE IMAGERY TO SCALE CLIMATE-SMART CROP INSURANCE (CULTIAF-2),"The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.  This project is funded through the second phase of the Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF-2), a joint program of IDRC and the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. CultiAF supports research to achieve long-term food security in eastern and southern Africa.",Yes,0.999882936477661

Theory of Change Observatory on Disaster Resilience,THEORY OF CHANGE OBSERVATORY ON DISASTER RESILIENCE,"Humanitarian disasters such as droughts expose approximately 10 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa to food, water and energy insecurity. Besides the humanitarian consequences disasters such as floods also heighten investment risks due to creation of 'stranded assets' such as wastewater treatment plants in developing countries. Global climate models can be used to identify the geographical distribution of disaster risk but without being able to specify the regional intensity, frequency and duration of events. In Sub-Saharan Africa the difference between what models forecast and the reality of dryness has come to be known as the 'East Africa Climate paradox'. Because of model inconsistency, it is difficult for investors and decision makers to be forewarned about impending events and to respond when they occur. Two recent policy trends have however converged to enhance the potential for Cyber-enabled Effective Disaster Response: (a) the expansion of Regional Early Warning Systems (REWS) and (b) a growing demand for open data platforms to enhance accountability of decision-making processes. For instance, the Africa Data Consensus (ADC) resolved to emphasize the role of open data networks to support coherent decision making through better organization of data and models. From a scientific standpoint Agent Based Modelling has also begun to advocate more forcefully for engagement of stakeholders to develop and calibrate models. In this regard, our prior research to pilot-test the Wastewater Reuse Effectiveness Index (WREI) for Sustainable Development Goal 6.3 revealed the potential of down-scaled models to advance circular economy pathways, such as wastewater recycling with potential to mitigate disaster risk. The overall aim of the Theory of change Observatory project will therefore be to enhance regional capacity to develop, pilot-test and validate regional climate models that enables the prediction, assessment and response to effects of droughts and flood risk by: (Obj 1) Developing a place-based observatory based on principles of dispersed data handling and reuse (Work Package (WP) 1,4), (Obj 2) Co-curating and co-designing regional research that focuses on down-scaling and coupling robust models of disaster risk monitoring (WP2,3), and (Obj 3) Pilot-testing and validating composite indices as a means of knowledge translation with the objective of building a theory of change on disaster resilience (WP5).",Yes,0.998995840549469

Open Network for WAter-Related Diseases (ONWARD),OPEN NETWORK FOR WATER-RELATED DISEASES (ONWARD),"The ONWARD Network (Open Network for Water-Related Diseases) is dedicated to forecasting, early warning & risk mapping for water-associated diseases through use of remote sensing, field observations & mathematical modelling. Our vision is to enable cost-effective, regularly updated, geo-referenced early warning for areas vulnerable to water-associated diseases, which in turn will enable preventive measures to be deployed in a timely manner to minimise the probability of epidemics. Our long-term vision is to establish a system that will be applicable broadly, in a variety of localities & for a variety of diseases. By 'water-associated' disease, we mean a rather broad class, including diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera, skin diseases associated with water-borne bacteria or metazoan parasites, vector-borne diseases such as malaria & dengue fever, & others such as hepatitis. The 'water' involved may be fresh, or brackish or coastal seawater. The network will respond primarily the GCRF Challenge of Global Health (infectious diseases), & secondarily to that of Resilience to Environmental Shocks & Change (since outbreaks of water-associated diseases are affected by extreme weather events, expected to become more frequent as a result of climate change). The network will also address UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, Target 3d, to 'Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction & management of national & global health risks.' According to the World Health Organisation, some two billion people use faecally-contaminated drinking water, putting them at risk of death or chronic poor health from water-borne infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid & polio. Provision of safe drinking water is hostage to the influence of extreme weather & flooding. Apart from the fatalities, the effect of a chronic burden of lower-level infection by water-associated diseases is antagonistic to the maintenance of a healthy work force & to the well-being of society in general, to the detriment of sustainable development. For example, cholera kills an estimated 95,000 people every year, but it also makes another 2.9 million seriously ill with a debilitating disease. Hence the need to address, in addition, the resilience of communities to perturbations of the safe drinking water supply under extreme weather events associated with a changing climate. Before now, our ability to develop early warning, risk reduction & management of national & global health risks due to water-associated diseases has been limited by mutual isolation of the scientific communities whose collective effort is required to make progress. Forecasting outbreaks of water-associated diseases & their geo-referenced risk mapping is a complex matter for which the collaboration of experts from several disciplines (ranging from environmental biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, social sciences & epidemiology to remote sensing & mode",Review,0.0168373193591833

COVID-19 Fiscal Response Program,COVID-19 FISCAL RESPONSE PROGRAM,"Vanuatu has avoided an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through decisive early action to close borders and adopt prevention and containment measures. As of 12 November 2020, the country had only one confirmed case of COVID-19 contained in quarantine after being identified from a repatriation flight. Vanuatu's efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have come at significant economic and social costs. The program will help finance the implementation of the government's countercyclical response, which is anchored on the Health Preparedness and Response Plan (HPRP) and the Economic Stimulus Program (ESP), to mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. The proposed program is aligned with four operational priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030â(i) addressing remaining poverty and addressing inequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and (iv) promoting rural development and food security.

UNDP Zimbabwe Resilience Building Fund 2017 - 2021,UNDP ZIMBABWE RESILIENCE BUILDING FUND 2017 - 2021,"The ZRBF aims to increase the resilience of households and communities in Zimbabwe experiencing poverty and extreme poverty and food insecurity, primarily at the rural level, with a strong focus of gender equality and the integration of women and youths in the programme. Additionally, the programme will aim to target a minimum of 800 000 individuals and communities particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climatic change. It must be noted that the ZRBF, with gender equality at the heart of its programming will aim to target a minimum of 400 000 women in its programming.The expected results for the ZRBF, with the funding available as per 2015, is to enhance food security and livelihood diversification strategies of targeted communities that increase resilience to recurrent stresses/shocks. More specifically the ZRBF is expected to: â¢ Increase effective evidence based institutional, legislative and policy frameworks in place at national and sub-national levels for resilience â¢ Increase the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities to face shocks and the effects of climate change for approximately 800,000 people in vulnerable communities frequently exposed to multiple hazards in a total of estimated 20 of Zimbabwe's 59 rural districts. â¢ Improved protection of household and community assets and decrease in annual economic losses due to effects of hazards and climate change â¢ A crisis modifier that can provide early warning and early action to reduce the impact of climate induced shocks in place for the Fund. (With the new planned budget allocation, a substantial increase in the target number of beneficiaries is estimated. While it is planned that 10-25% of programmable funds will be allocated to this result area, final beneficiaries number will be subject to further needs assessment and also based on the nature of the shocks/crises and scope of the planned response.)",Review,0.00828167703002691

Strengthening the Resilience of the Mozambique Health System to Climate Change Impacts,STRENGTHENING THE RESILIENCE OF THE MOZAMBIQUE HEALTH SYSTEM TO CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS,"Background: A high proportion of Mozambique's total disease burden comes from climate sensitive disease (e.g malaria and diarrheal disease) or disease whose adequate management is jeopardized by frequent climate shocks (e.g HIV/AIDS). Additionally, significant national health determinants, such as water and sanitation systems and food production systems, may yet be further adversely impacted by climate variability and change. -- These vulnerabilities, combined with the poor adaptive capacity in underfunded key institutions and health programs, and lack of investments in training and advanced technology are manifest in current poor national health outcomes, which are expected to decline even more under future projected climate changes. -- The current project aims at strengthening the climate resilience of Mozambique's National Health System, in order to allow it to prepare, cope with and manage the health risks posed by climate variability and change, in a way that the essential functions of health systems are less vulnerable to climate and that facilitates sustained improvements in population health outcomes, despite an unstable climate. -- This project works on three tiers aiming to1) Improve governance, institutional and human capacity2) Strengthen existing climate sensitive disease surveillance systems, and scientific evidence on health impacts from climate change3) Build the resilience of specific health policies, strategies, programmes and plans - Specific Purpose : Among the expected outputs the project will: -- 1) Strengthen the national plan for Health Adaptation to Climate Change to ensure better governance of health adaptation.  -- 2) Establish health sector internal and external coordination mechanism to combat climate change impact to ensure maximum benefit from joint action.  -- 3) Include climate risks in core health education programs to ensure sustainable capacity building. -- 4) Mainstreams climate risk management into the National Disease Control Programs, and Health Promotion strategy and relevant health policies. -- 5) Set national research priorities to inform decisions and increase national research capacity. -- 6) Strengthen climate sensitive disease information systems.  -- 7) Develop tools for health national health authorities to manage climate risks to health (e.g. integrated risk monitoring systems to monitor climate risks to health, early warning systems, health seasonal outlooks). -- 8) Increase national communication on climate risks to health -- 9) Improve preparedness and response to climate extreme events.",Review,0.00412285421043634

Support to the Fund is helping to achieve its objectives, including: (1) promoting early action and response to reduce loss of life, (2) enhancing response to time-critical humanitarian requirements, and (3) strengthening core elements of humanitarian response in underfunded crises. / Mars 2020 - On estime que 9,3 millions de personnes partout au Soudan ont besoin d'aide humanitaire et de protection en raison du conflit armÃ©, de l'insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire, de la malnutrition, du dÃ©clin Ã©conomique et de la maladie. Environ 1,9 million de personnes sont dÃ©placÃ©es Ã  l'intÃ©rieur du Soudan et prÃ¨s de 1,1 million de rÃ©fugiÃ©s, demandeurs d'asile et migrants de la RÃ©publique centrafricaine, du Tchad, de l'ÃrythrÃ©e, de l'Ãthiopie, du Soudan du Sud et de la Syrie sont prÃ©sents dans le pays. On estime que 6,2 millions de personnes sont actuellement en situation de grave insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire, ce qui aggrave des niveaux de malnutrition dÃ©jÃ  Ã©levÃ©s.

Il s'agit Ã  la fois d'une crise de santÃ© publique et d'une crise humanitaire qui a des rÃ©percussions sur la vie, la santÃ© et les moyens de subsistance des populations du monde entier. L'impact potentiel du COVID-19 sur les personnes les plus vulnÃ©rables du monde, dÃ©jÃ  touchÃ©es par les dÃ©placements, les conflits, les catastrophes naturelles et le changement climatique, en fait la menace actuelle la plus urgente.Le 26 mars dernier, la FICR a lancÃ© un appel de 550 millions CHF pour soutenir les SociÃ©tÃ©s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (ci-aprÃ¨s, SN) dans les domaines des soins de santÃ©, du prÃ©positionnement des marchandises, de la communication des risques, des enseignements tirÃ©s du rÃ©seau mondial d'intervenants locaux, des transferts monÃ©taires pour les familles et de l'attÃ©nuation des effets des grandes Ã©pidÃ©mies. Sur les 550 millions CHF, 150 millions sont destinÃ©s Ã  la FICR pour soutenir les SN dans le besoin, tandis que les 400 millions restants seront collectÃ©s par les SN au niveau national. L'intervention de la FICR proposÃ©e pour un financement belge s'inscrit dans les 150 millions CHF recherchÃ©s par la FICR dans son appel d'urgence â Ã©pidÃ©mie COVID-19 (Â« IFRC Revised Emergency Appeal MDR00005: COVID-19 outbreak Â», annexe 2b). A noter que dÃ©jÃ  le 31 janvier dernier, la FICR avait lancÃ© un appel d'urgence â Ã©pidÃ©mie COVID-19 qui recherchait 3 millions CHF. Vu l'ampleur de la crise, cet appel a Ã©tÃ© rÃ©visÃ© et relancÃ© le 26 mars avec une nouvelle planification et un nouveau montant de 150 millions CHF. Le DREF, fonds flexible de la FICR que la Belgique finance en 2020 avec 1,5 millions EUR, a dÃ©jÃ  permis de soutenir l'appel d'urgence de la FICR avec 1 million CHF. La FICR et ses 192 SN sont solidaires envers les personnes affectÃ©es par la crise COVID-19 et en premiÃ¨re ligne des rÃ©ponses communautaires Ã  cette pandÃ©mie dans le monde entier. Avec plus de 160.000 bureaux locaux et plus de 13 millions de volontaires et de collaborateurs de confiance, la FICR et les SN sont particuliÃ¨rement bien placÃ©es pour aider les personnes et leurs communautÃ©s Ã  se prÃ©parer et Ã  rÃ©pondre Ã  cette urgence mondiale. Combinant l'expertise d'acteurs sanitaires et humanitaires qui travaillent dans leurs propres communautÃ©s, la FICR et ses membres offrent une perspective et des outils mondiaux, associÃ©s Ã  une prÃ©sence locale et une rÃ©ponse nationale dans toutes les rÃ©gions du monde.

URBE Latam: Understanding Risks and Building Enhanced Capabilities in Latin American cities,URBE LATAM: UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND BUILDING ENHANCED CAPABILITIES IN LATIN AMERICAN CITIES,"URBE Latam addresses the implementation gap between sustainable development and equitable resilience. It will do so by using a transdisciplinary research approach aimed at empowering residents of disaster-prone urban poor neighbourhoods, which will underpin the co-production of enhanced, context-specific understandings of local risks and the integration of the resulting data into decision-making procedures in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development monitoring.   The project is conducted by a highly skilled multi-disciplinary research team (including social sciences, engineering and physical sciences) and adopts a dialogic co-production approach to citizen-generated data which relies upon well-established partnerships with community-based initiatives for local development, education and disaster risk reduction in Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, as well as with governmental agencies involved in disaster risk reduction and local planning and development.  URBE Latam proceeds in four integrated components that seek an enhanced understanding of risks, vulnerabilities and local capabilities in disaster-prone urban areas: first it is centred on the engagement of citizens to generate data to expand understandings of risks at the neighbourhood level, second, citizens engagement in risk will be pursued alongside an analysis of socio-spatial inequalities in resilience and development indicators and policies at city and national level, third, this will lead to the recalibration of environmental risk mapping with citizen-generated data, fourth, these components are articulated and integrated within a framework to facilitate dialogic transformations across the different levels and stakeholders involved.  The process of advancing these outputs will further enable capacity development in local communities and the governments of Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, a process which will be augmented by improving the awareness of stakeholders in other Latin American cities and countries through broader dissemination.  Insights from collaboratively produced citizen-generated data will be integrated into the practices of disaster risk management and development monitoring (e.g. SDG reporting) in collaboration with international policymaking agencies, thus enabling transformations towards more equitable disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. As an overarching outcome, the project will enable the transformation of practices, improve knowledge among a diverse range of stakeholders and enhance capacity to promote equitable resilience.",Review,0.000577683618757874
