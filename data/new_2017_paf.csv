The specific expected outcomes of the project will be (1) Vulnerable communities adopt risk transfer (insurance) products, as a part of comprehensive adaptation framework which also builds on disaster risk reduction, (2) Viable climate insurance products and models are up-scaled and mainstreamed into frameworks, policies and regulations of the Government, (3) Enhanced capacities and knowledge drive innovations in climate insurance products, by public and private sector institutions, thus meeting the demands of vulnerable communities. The project will draw from Swiss knowledge, expertise and experiences on financial instruments in risk transfer in addressing climate change. As the climate insurance solutions that are to be developed under the initiative will be generic in nature, the knowledge and insights gained could be adapted in other developing countries.",Informal/semi-formal financial intermediaries,Yes,0.9998379945755

Additionally, the programme will aim to target a minimum of 800 000 individuals and communities particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climatic change. It must be noted that the ZRBF, with gender equality at the heart of its programming will aim to target a minimum of 400 000 women in its programming.The expected results for the ZRBF, with the funding available as per 2015, is to enhance food security and livelihood diversification strategies of targeted communities that increase resilience to recurrent stresses/shocks. More specifically the ZRBF is expected to: • Increase effective evidence based institutional, legislative and policy frameworks in place at national and sub-national levels for resilience • Increase the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities to face shocks and the effects of climate change for approximately 800,000 people in vulnerable communities frequently exposed to multiple hazards in a total of estimated 20 of Zimbabwe's 59 rural districts. • Improved protection of household and community assets and decrease in annual economic losses due to effects of hazards and climate change • A crisis modifier that can provide early warning and early action to reduce the impact of climate induced shocks in place for the Fund. (With the new planned budget allocation, a substantial increase in the target number of beneficiaries is estimated. While it is planned that 10-25% of programmable funds will be allocated to this result area, final beneficiaries number will be subject to further needs assessment and also based on the nature of the shocks/crises and scope of the planned response.)",Rural development,Review,0.0198608189821243

Lebanese municipalities are the primary line of response to the Syrian refugee crisis despite being very under-resourced to provide the services they are expected to deliver. In host communities, many people rely on informal mechanisms to resolve conflict, and those with little social capital, such as women, youth, and refugees may avoid claiming their rights altogether, leaving grievances unaddressed.Project activities include: (1) strengthening the municipal police force, (2) developing an early warning and early response mechanism to monitor and respond to tensions in host communities, and (3) providing legal aid to vulnerable people, especially women. The project also promotes measures to increase the number of female municipal police officers and sensitize both the judicial and municipal police to issues of violence against women./Ce projet vise à aider les autorités libanaises à fournir des services de sécurité et de justice de base dans les collectivités d'accueil. Les municipalités libanaises sont la principale ligne de réponse à la crise des réfugiés syriens, malgré le fait qu'elles manquent de ressources pour fournir les services qu'ils devraient fournir. Dans les collectivités d'accueil, de nombreuses personnes comptent sur des mécanismes informels pour résoudre des conflits, et ceux qui ont peu de capital social, comme les femmes, les jeunes et les réfugiés, renoncent souvent à réclamer faire valoir leurs droits, ce qui laisse leurs griefs non résolus.Les activités du projet comprennent les suivantes : 1) le renforcement des forces de police municipales, 2) la mise en place d'un mécanisme d'alerte et de réponse précoces pour surveiller les tensions dans les collectivités d'accueil et y remédier, 3) de l'aide juridique pour les personnes vulnérables, en particulier pour les femmes. Le projet favorise également des mesures visant à accroître le nombre de femmes au sein des forces de police municipales et à sensibiliser à la fois la police judiciaire et municipale aux problèmes de violence envers les femmes.","Civilian peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution",Review,0.0141801219433546

For this purpose, some agricultural residues will be used as a source for isolation of cellulosic nanomaterials with different technologies available at the Swedish and Egyptian partners. Technologies available at the Swedish side include ultra-fine grinding, high pressure homogenization, and electro-spinning while the Egyptian side will use chemical/mechanical methods using high shear homogenizers. Different parameters will be studied to optimize the isolation of cellulosic nanomaterials regarding the yield and properties. The isolated nanomaterials will be y characterized using different tools including SEM, TEM, AFM, XRD, FTIR, surface charge, elemental analyses, and microbial resistance. The isolated nanomaterials will be assembled in form of ultrafiltration membranes with tailor made structure to study their use for water treatment. The membranes will be characterized regarding their structure, porosity, pore size, density, mechanical properties and surface characteristics.The project will be implemented in three years. The first year will involve isolation of nanomaterials and their characterization, the second and third year will involve application of the isolated of the nanomaterials for assembling membranes and testing their efficiency for water purification.",Environmental research,Review,0.000148897961480543
