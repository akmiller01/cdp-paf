Climate resilience through risk,CLIMATE RESILIENCE THROUGH RISK,"The overall goal of the RES-RISK project will be to enhance climate resilience and promote adaptive capacities of the vulnerable through risk transfer options and solutions. The specific expected outcomes of the project will be (1) Vulnerable communities adopt risk transfer (insurance) products, as a part of comprehensive adaptation framework which also builds on disaster risk reduction, (2) Viable climate insurance products and models are up-scaled and mainstreamed into frameworks, policies and regulations of the Government, (3) Enhanced capacities and knowledge drive innovations in climate insurance products, by public and private sector institutions, thus meeting the demands of vulnerable communities. The project will draw from Swiss knowledge, expertise and experiences on financial instruments in risk transfer in addressing climate change. As the climate insurance solutions that are to be developed under the initiative will be generic in nature, the knowledge and insights gained could be adapted in other developing countries.",Yes,0.9998379945755

Additionally, the programme will aim to target a minimum of 800 000 individuals and communities particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climatic change. It must be noted that the ZRBF, with gender equality at the heart of its programming will aim to target a minimum of 400 000 women in its programming.The expected results for the ZRBF, with the funding available as per 2015, is to enhance food security and livelihood diversification strategies of targeted communities that increase resilience to recurrent stresses/shocks. More specifically the ZRBF is expected to: â¢ Increase effective evidence based institutional, legislative and policy frameworks in place at national and sub-national levels for resilience â¢ Increase the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities to face shocks and the effects of climate change for approximately 800,000 people in vulnerable communities frequently exposed to multiple hazards in a total of estimated 20 of Zimbabwe's 59 rural districts. â¢ Improved protection of household and community assets and decrease in annual economic losses due to effects of hazards and climate change â¢ A crisis modifier that can provide early warning and early action to reduce the impact of climate induced shocks in place for the Fund. (With the new planned budget allocation, a substantial increase in the target number of beneficiaries is estimated. While it is planned that 10-25% of programmable funds will be allocated to this result area, final beneficiaries number will be subject to further needs assessment and also based on the nature of the shocks/crises and scope of the planned response.)",Review,0.00828167703002691

Approximately 1.85 million people are internally displaced within South Sudan and over 1.4 million South Sudanese have sought protection in neighbouring countries. The civil war, as well as erratic rainfall in some areas, have resulted in 4.6 million people projected to require food assistance, with malnutrition rates over emergency thresholds. Outbreaks of cholera, measles, and hepatitis E have strained an already overwhelmed health system. Humanitarian access remains restricted in many conflict areas and large numbers of people are accessible only by air drops.With GAC's support, the South Sudan Common Humanitarian Fund is providing timely allocations to national and international NGOs and United Nations agencies to meet critical humanitarian needs of people throughout the country. The Fund is managed by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office.

The project scope is articulated in the following three components:o Component 1: Development of Domestic Geothermal Power Generation Capacity (estimated costs US$34 million),o Component 2: Contingent Financing in Aid of Additional Drilling (estimated costs US$9 million), ando Component 3: Technical Assistance for Advancing LGPP to Development Status and Soliciting Private Sector Investment (estimated costs US$2.5 million)",Review,0.000391248177038506

Enhancing Community Security and Access to Justice in Lebanese Host Communities/AmÃ©liorer la sÃ©curitÃ© communautaire et l'accÃ¨s Ã  la justice dans les communautÃ©s d'accueil au Liban,ENHANCING COMMUNITY SECURITY AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN LEBANESE HOST COMMUNITIES/AMÃLIORER LA SÃCURITÃ COMMUNAUTAIRE ET L'ACCÃS Ã LA JUSTICE DANS LES C,"This project aims to help Lebanese authorities provide basic security and justice services in host communities. Lebanese municipalities are the primary line of response to the Syrian refugee crisis despite being very under-resourced to provide the services they are expected to deliver. In host communities, many people rely on informal mechanisms to resolve conflict, and those with little social capital, such as women, youth, and refugees may avoid claiming their rights altogether, leaving grievances unaddressed.Project activities include: (1) strengthening the municipal police force, (2) developing an early warning and early response mechanism to monitor and respond to tensions in host communities, and (3) providing legal aid to vulnerable people, especially women. The project also promotes measures to increase the number of female municipal police officers and sensitize both the judicial and municipal police to issues of violence against women./Ce projet vise Ã  aider les autoritÃ©s libanaises Ã  fournir des services de sÃ©curitÃ© et de justice de base dans les collectivitÃ©s d'accueil. Les municipalitÃ©s libanaises sont la principale ligne de rÃ©ponse Ã  la crise des rÃ©fugiÃ©s syriens, malgrÃ© le fait qu'elles manquent de ressources pour fournir les services qu'ils devraient fournir. Dans les collectivitÃ©s d'accueil, de nombreuses personnes comptent sur des mÃ©canismes informels pour rÃ©soudre des conflits, et ceux qui ont peu de capital social, comme les femmes, les jeunes et les rÃ©fugiÃ©s, renoncent souvent Ã  rÃ©clamer faire valoir leurs droits, ce qui laisse leurs griefs non rÃ©solus.Les activitÃ©s du projet comprennent les suivantes : 1) le renforcement des forces de police municipales, 2) la mise en place d'un mÃ©canisme d'alerte et de rÃ©ponse prÃ©coces pour surveiller les tensions dans les collectivitÃ©s d'accueil et y remÃ©dier, 3) de l'aide juridique pour les personnes vulnÃ©rables, en particulier pour les femmes. Le projet favorise Ã©galement des mesures visant Ã  accroÃ®tre le nombre de femmes au sein des forces de police municipales et Ã  sensibiliser Ã  la fois la police judiciaire et municipale aux problÃ¨mes de violence envers les femmes.",Review,0.000357181153958663
