Por tanto, el objetivo Ãºltimo del proyecto es contribuir de forma eficiente a la cobertura de las necesidades alimentarias de la poblaciÃ³n refugiada saharaui. La pertinencia de la acciÃ³n se basa en la necesidad primaria de alimento por parte de la poblaciÃ³n saharaui que, debido a su status de refugiados y teniendo en cuenta las caracterÃ­sticas totalmente improductivas del terreno, son totalmente dependientes de la ayuda aportada desde el exterior. La Base de Transportes (BdT) nace como respuesta a la necesidad de distribuir la ayuda alimentaria desde los almacenes centrales de Media Luna Roja Saharaui hasta cada uno de los 5 diferentes campos que se encuentran mÃ¡s o menos distantes (desde los 11 kms del mÃ¡scercano hasta los 152 del mÃ¡s lejano).Tras casi 12 aÃ±os de funcionamiento, la Base de Transportes cuenta con un equipo humano conformado por 46 personas entre chÃ³feres, mecÃ¡nicos, soldadores, administrativos y personal de apoyo (vigilantes, cocinero, etc). Igualmente se cuentacon 21 vehÃ­culos de transporte asignados de los cuales 17 (de ellos 11 rÃ­gidos y 6 trÃ¡iler) realizan funciones de reparto de alimentos con una capacidad de carga teÃ³rica de 292 Tn/dÃ­a. Como consecuencia, la Ãºltima informaciÃ³n consolidada arroja que entre enero y diciembre de 2016, la BdT cumpliÃ³ el objetivo planificado distribuyendo el 100 % de la ?Canasta BÃ¡sica? al 100% de la poblaciÃ³n refugiada saharaui, se transportaron 25.738 tn. en 1.819 viajes de camiÃ³n entre los almacenes de la MLRS y las distintas wilayas, del mismo modo, se distribuyÃ³ el 100% del ?Producto Fresco? transportando un total de 4.713,98tn en 573 viajes de camiÃ³n. En ningÃºn momento, la distribuciÃ³n alimentaria se viÃ³ interumpida por falta de vehÃ­culos o averÃ­as en ruta gracias a una disponibilidad de flota del 83,88%. Todo ello se pudo realizar gracias a un eficiente trabajo de mantenimiento preventivo y correctivo, habiÃ©ndose realizado durante este periodo 676 intervenciones correctiivas y 292 preventivas. (ver anexo 1. Informe indicadores 2016)Los principales retos del proyecto en la actualidad son principalemente, continuar distribuyendo el 100% de los alimentos y como novedad, lograr asumir en una primera fase, la distribuciÃ³n del gas en las Wilayas de Bojador y Auserd.

Las comunidades residentes en las zonas bajas son cÃ­clicamente afectadas, destruyÃ©ndose viviendas, infraestructuras pÃºblicas bÃ¡sicas (puestos de salud, escuelas, fuentes de agua, etc.) y sociales, como mezquitas o centros comunitarios. Los huertos localizados en las zonas bajas son devastados, afectando principalmente a las mujeres que son, en su inmensa mayorÃ­a, las que trabajan la tierra. Otra constataciÃ³n en la GDR es la casi total ausencia de las mujeres, y con ello la falta de estrategias para la consideraciÃ³n del enfoque de gÃ©nero en este Ã¡mbito. A pesar de que existe muy poca informaciÃ³n desagregada por sexo, es claro que las mujeres y la infancia han sido los grupos mÃ¡s afectados en situaciones de emergencia. La gestiÃ³n de la economÃ­a de los cuidados durante esos periodos se dificulta enormemente, y son las mujeres las que deben suplir las carencias existentes en derechos bÃ¡sicos como el agua, la alimentaciÃ³n, etc., y la atenciÃ³n a la infancia durante el cierre de las escuelas. AsÃ­, la estrategia de intervenciÃ³n parte de la concienciaciÃ³n masiva sobre los riesgos ambientales, como base para la creaciÃ³n de un Sistema Comunitario de GDR en 4 localidades. De esta forma, los grupos afectados serÃ¡n los agentes del cambio en sus comunidades, con el objetivo de que sean mÃ¡s conscientes, estÃ©n mejor preparados para las emergencias y vivan con mayor seguridad.&#34,",Yes,0.984870493412018

Unlike food and medical supplies which are often provided instantly for refugees and displaced people, the SRHR services and needs are largely overlooked in response to relief assistance for refugees. However, they are of no less importance to the refugees as women, girls and children, who constitute the big majority of the refugee population, suffer disproportionately from sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), unwanted pregnancies, unsafe delivery and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including HIV and AIDS. In most conflict settings these risks are heightened as women and girls lack means to protect themselves and their families. Without targeted SRHR intervention women and girls face an increased risk of early and forced marriage, sexual abuse and exchanging of sex for basic goods. The intervention will help increase availability of women friendly spaces to create women's and girls' awareness on and risk reduction of SGBV, post abortion care, treatment of STIs and HIV testing kits.The intervention will target 277,756 people of which 188,875 are South Sudan refugees located in Leitchor, Terkidi and & Kule refugee camps in NyeinNyang, Lare and Itang Woredas and 88,881 are surrounding host communities in the same Woreda.The intervention aims to help increase improved availability, access and use of comprehensive SRHR services, reduced prevalence of sexual gender-based violence (SGBV), Increased access and utilization of Basic Emergency Obstetric and New-born Care (BEmONC) and Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and New-born care (CEmONC) services, and reduced incidence of HIV among the refugees and the host communities..Given that refugees reside alongside host communities, the needs of host communities and refugees are inextricably linked. Public services in host communities surrounding the refugees are usually stretched beyond their capacity as they are facing an unprecedented increase in demand for health and other social services. To mitigate the impact of refugee on host communities, the intervention will reinforce basic services to host populations. It will also provide lifesaving medical assistance, reproductive and maternal drugs, equipment and supplies, train health staffs and buffer them through secondment of staffs and strengthen the referral system through provision of ambulances to increase the provision of services. In both refugee and host communities, adolescent and young people reproductive health services are provided in the context of general health services. In order to create access to family planning service, treatment of STIs/HIV, post abortion care, and information on for young peoples without barrier, the intervention will provide adolescent and youth focused reproductive health services and information.

"Food security drought prevention, mitigation, preparedness and early recovery support to PNG","FOOD SECURITY DROUGHT PREVENTION, MITIGATION, PREPAREDNESS AND EARLY RECOVERY SUPPORT TO PNG","The current El Nino event in the Pacific Ocean is affecting Papua New Guinea in the form of drought and frost. The lack of sustained rainfall and the repeated frost event have resulted in the decreased production from food gardens and therefore reduced availability of food. The Government estimates that 2.4 million people are currently affected by drought and frost, from which 1.3 million are severely affected. The major constraints are reduced access to clean drinking water as well as water availability for agriculture activities, reduced food availability and accessibility of food (drastic increase in basic food prices in markets), reduction of meals to 1 per day in the most affected areas and crop losses and increased cases of plant diseases, leading to lack of planting materials.Support needs were identified in the following areas:1. Overall coordination of food security activities at National and Provincial level2. Food Security Drought monitoring3. Planting material for farmers (drought-tolerant crops, early maturing varieties)The objective of this project is to support DAL to prepare and respond to the food security needs, in close collaboration with other actors involved in food security (NARI, FPDA, NGOs, CBOs). The support will target four of the worst affected provinces: Southern Highland, Simbu, Enga and Morobe. Activities will include coordination support, support to the development of a drought monitoring system, provision of planting & smart irrigation materials as well as dissemination of food security drought adaptation messaging to farmers.This will be done in such a way as to reach, and be used by, those communities who are highly impacted by the drought and are in a position to adopt and make best use of information and practices that are shared. The project will achieve this by working with relevant line ministries, national organizations, regional partners, and directly with subsistence farming households in the most affected province of Simbu, Enga, SHP and Morobe to:1.Strengthen the institutional capacities to coordinate food security drought preparedness and early recovery2.Support institutional capacities to develop and supervise a food security drought monitoring system3.Support the dissemination of food security drought adaptation good practices among subsistence farming communities, in collaboration with NGOs, CBO, NARI and FPDA support,4.Support early recovery activities through the multiplication and dissemination of early maturing sweet potato, Irish potato and cassava planting materials as well as purchase and distribution of early maturing beans, pumpkin and open pollinated corn seeds and smart irrigation materials (drip irrigation hose).",Yes,0.979497790336609

Economic Recovery Support Program (Subprogram 2),ECONOMIC RECOVERY SUPPORT PROGRAM (SUBPROGRAM 2),"The Samoa ERSP is a program cluster of two subprogram loans totaling $26.82 million. The ERSP program cluster aims to assist Samoa's economic recovery and movement to a higher medium-term growth rate, following the double impact of the global economic crisis and the September 2009 tsunami. Subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support improved fiscal management and structural measures that will place the economy on a sustainable medium-term growth path. Budget support will help create the fiscal space to enable raised levels of capital spending over the medium term. This will be complemented by measures that enable targeting of services to protect the vulnerable and by engagement with key stakeholders.Subprogram 2 completes the program reform agenda under the ERSP program cluster. Subprogram 2 is consistent with the strategic focus of the country partnership strategy for Samoa (2008-2012) to address binding constraints to growth, including deficiencies in access to public services and in the quality of public service delivery, and weaknesses in the private sector-enabling environment. Subprogram 2 of the ERSP program cluster supports the government's economic and financial reform program in coordination with key development partners including Australia, the European Union and the World Bank. The national elections, in March 2011, slowed the formulation and implementation of policy and as such proved a challenge to the program cluster. Subsequent to this, the government remains strongly committed to continuing dialogue with development partners. Subprogram 2 loan financing will help meet the Government's overall budget financing needs, particularly given the adjustment costs arising from implementing an economic reform program to place the economy on a sustainable growth path. Structural and governance measures will strengthen prospects for sustaining economic growth over the medium term.

Se trata de una poblaciÃ³n de 190 familias, (950 personas), que, al no tratarse de poblaciÃ³n ubicada dentro de campos de refugiados y refugiadas, tiene mayores dificultades para acceder a ayuda humanitaria.Por ello el proyecto se propone dotar a esta poblaciÃ³n de ayuda alimentaria, asistencia bÃ¡sica sanitaria y apoyo psicosocial. En este sentido se prevÃ© la realizaciÃ³n de las siguientes actividades:1. Compra y distribuciÃ³n de alimentos y combustible. Para ello, en coordinaciÃ³n con las familias beneficiarias se definirÃ¡n los alimentos bÃ¡sicos que deberÃ¡n formar parte del kit de alimentos a distribuir, se comprarÃ¡n estos alimentos y el combustible y se distribuirÃ¡n los kits.2.

"Conflict-Related Sexual Violences: Understanding What, When and Why","CONFLICT-RELATED SEXUAL VIOLENCES: UNDERSTANDING WHAT, WHEN AND WHY","Finally, sexual violence in war has been recognized as a pressing global security problem in policy and research. Yet, much still needs to be done to better understand its dynamics and to more effectively work towards its prevention. The overarching category of sexual violence remains imprecise as a legal and policy tool, and potentially misleading as a common category for a vast array of acts in disparate contexts, driven by different logics, and with different effects. Drawing on the unique expertise of the research team and focusing its inquiry to the Great Lakes region in Africa, the aim of this research project is to further query and comprehend the variations in conflict-related sexual violence against women/girls and men/boys in this site. The project asks four interrelated research questions: 1) What are the dominant forms, 2) prevailing contexts, 3) logics of sexual violence?, 4) How is sexual violence delineated in legal, policy and academic texts? It will answer these questions by: analysing documented sexual violence cases, conducting individual screening, in depth interviews and participatory group research with refugee populations, interviewing ex-combatants and soldiers/combatants convicted of sexual violence, analyzing legal, policy and academic texts. Ultimately, it will contribute to general knowledge about conflict-related sexual violence, and provide a more nuanced picture against which comparisons with other conflict and non-conflict settings can be made.",Yes,0.97773414850235

El epicentro se produjo a 19 km de profundidad. El cantÃ³n de Pedernales (ubicado en la provincia de ManabÃ­) es una de las localidades mÃ¡s afectadas. El Gobierno de Ecuador ha declarado el estado de emergencia en las seis provincias mÃ¡s afectadas y se han activado los ClÃºster de emergencia humanitaria (grupos de coordinaciÃ³n por sectores). Una de las primeras intervenciones que se realiza tras una emergencia es garantizar el acceso a agua potable y a instalaciones de saneamiento seguras y adecuadas. Las instalaciones suelen quedar destruidas y, hasta que el paÃ­s puede empezar a reconstruir las infraestructuras y los sistemas de canalizaciÃ³n de agua potable y de saneamiento, hay que garantizar que la poblaciÃ³n tenga acceso a instalaciones seguras, lo que servirÃ¡ para prevenir, ademÃ¡s, la proliferaciÃ³n de enfermedades transmisibles por el agua. UNICEF es la agencia humanitaria lÃ­der del clÃºster de WASH (Agua, Saneamiento e Higiene) para las emergencias. Como tal, coordina las actuaciones que los distintos actores humanitarios realizan dentro de este sector.En el marco de la presente propuesta, UNICEF suministrarÃ¡ agua potable y segura a travÃ©s de plantas potabilizadoras de agua y tanques de 5.000 litros, garantizarÃ¡ condiciones de saneamiento adecuadas mediante la construcciÃ³n de letrinas y asegurarÃ¡ buenas prÃ¡cticas de higiene con la distribuciÃ³n de kits familiares de higiene.

Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project,GUANGXI WUZHOU URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,"Wuzhou city is a medium-sized city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou. The outcomes of the Project include improved environmental management through the enhanced disaster management and infrastructure and improved municipal services, particularly in the areas of wastewater management and solid waste management.",Yes,0.973655641078949

The floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing 32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at $55 million. The Project aims to help Tajikistan address recurring flood risks through a holistic and coordinated approach involving both physical and non-physical measures in one of the most floodprone areas in the country - Hamadoni, Farkhor, Kulyab, and Vose districts in Khatlon province. A major part of the Project funds will be used for the physical works for the rehabilitation of 8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In addition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, strengthen flood warning systems, prepare a flood preparedness and evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by rehabilitating the hydrometeorological network. Given that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the possible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan were examined. The initial environment examination study found that there is unlikely to be significant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on ecological resources and socioeconomic conditions in the area. In addition, the project will help the Government define and implement the policy reforms needed to improve its flood preparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and maintenance (O&M) funding constraints for the flood levees and bank protection works.The Project will strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the local government bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to applyneed-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for the flood protection structures. The application of performance based O&M contracts will also be pilot tested.",Yes,0.973109185695648

Summary: As many as two million people live in informal settlements in Kampala, with the slums of Central, Nakawa, and Kawempe Divisions regarded as the most vulnerable in terms of flood risk and levels of poverty. Although access to clean water and public latrines has been improving in some areas through government and NGO efforts, the majority of residents still lack access to decent affordable water supply and sanitation services. Three in every four illnesses are water borne or preventable, accounting for 17% of deaths in children under-five. Many schools lack even basic facilities let alone separate latrines allowing privacy and appropriate segregation for girls and boys.

The extension project will see construction of water catchment tanks and separate latrine facilities in 30 schools, benefiting a total of 24,000 children, especially girls. At the same time, public information and training programmes will increase hygiene understanding amongst school children and wider communities, promote the construction of household latrines and give a voice to slum dwellers as they hold local authorities to account and work to further improve living conditions.

To achieve these objectives, PSNP provides food insecure households with predictable food or cash transfers. In exchange for these transfers, PSNP beneficiaries participate in public works activities to build community assets and improve watershed management, a number of these activities build resilience to climate change.

Ensuring the right of education to girls and women of Segou city. Segou region. Mali.,ENSURING THE RIGHT OF EDUCATION TO GIRLS AND WOMEN OF SEGOU CITY. SEGOU REGION. MALI.,"TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: AcciÃ³n humanitaria para atender a la poblaciÃ³n afectada por el HuracÃ¡n Matthew en HaitÃ­ :: Una de las primeras intervenciones que se realiza tras una emergencia es garantizar el acceso a agua potable y a instalaciones de saneamiento seguras y adecuadas.Las instalaciones suelen quedar destruidas y, hasta que el paÃ­s puede empezar a reconstruir las infraestructuras y los sistemas de canalizaciÃ³n de agua potable y de saneamiento, hay que garantizar que la poblaciÃ³n tenga acceso a instalaciones seguras, lo que servirÃ¡ para prevenir, ademÃ¡s, la proliferaciÃ³n de enfermedades transmisibles por el agua.  UNICEF HaitÃ­ estÃ¡ dando apoyo al Gobierno en la coordinaciÃ³n del grupo de trabajo de WASH (Agua, Saneamiento e Higiene) para las emergencias. Como tal, coordina las actuaciones que los distintos actores humanitarios realizan dentro de este sector.En el caso del HuracÃ¡n Matthew en HaitÃ­, esto cobra especial relevancia puesto que hay un alto riesgo de aumento del cÃ³lera, que es endÃ©mico en el paÃ­s y desde el 2010 se ha cobrado 10.000 vidas. Las inundaciones, las malas condiciones higiÃ©nicas y de saneamiento que ha dejado a su paso el huracÃ¡n, unido al escaso acceso a agua potable antes del desastre es la tormenta perfecta para la dispersiÃ³n de la enfermedad. Los casos de cÃ³lera que se estÃ¡n dando en alguna de las principales ciudades no estÃ¡n siendo atendidos adecuadamente tampoco porque los centros de tratamiento del cÃ³lera estÃ¡n gravemente daÃ±ados.En el marco de la presente propuesta, UNICEF instalarÃ¡ letrinas mÃ³viles y suministrarÃ¡ agua potable en tanques de 10.000 litros, asÃ­ como kits de agua e higiene para familias. TambiÃ©n se darÃ¡ apoyo a instalaciones de WASH en los Espacios Amigos de la Infancia y las escuelas temporales que UNICEF estÃ¡ habilitando en las zonas mÃ¡s afectadas por el huracÃ¡n.UNICEF estÃ¡ presente en HaitÃ­ desde 1949. El Acuerdo Base de CooperaciÃ³n se firmÃ³ el 21 de julio de 1983. Desde 1961 UNICEF ComitÃ© EspaÃ±ol trabaja en colaboraciÃ³n con todas las oficinas de UNICEF en el mundo, incluyendo la oficina de HaitÃ­. Desde hace unos aÃ±os existe una sÃ³lida colaboraciÃ³n, que va desde el aporte de recursos econÃ³micos para acciones de WASH como consecuencia del terremoto ocurrido en HaitÃ­ en 2010. Aparte de contribuir a paliar las necesidades bÃ¡sicas de la poblaciÃ³n en cuanto a WASH, desde el ComitÃ© EspaÃ±ol, se financiÃ³ un proyecto de protecciÃ³n para que los niÃ±os y niÃ±as mÃ¡s vulnerables que habÃ­an quedado desprotegidos a causa del terremoto consiguiesen reunirse con sus familias. AdemÃ¡s de la financiaciÃ³n, UNICEF ComitÃ© EspaÃ±ol trabaja en las Ã¡reas de comunicaciÃ³n y sensibilizaciÃ³n informando sobre la situaciÃ³n de la infancia en HaitÃ­, y explicando los avances que se estÃ¡n produciendo en el paÃ­s a travÃ©s de la web www.unicef.es y otros canales.",Yes,0.954255163669586

SME Development Project T3 (Additional Financing),SME DEVELOPMENT PROJECT T3 (ADDITIONAL FINANCING),"On 15 December 2014, ADB approved the tranche 3 project (Tranche 3), a $130 million financial intermediation loan from ADB's ordinary capital resources, based on the periodic financing request received from the Government of Kazakhstan on 31 October 2014. The borrower, as in previous tranches, is Damu Entrepreneurship Development Fund (Damu), the government entity tasked with SME development. The loan will be guaranteed by the Republic of Kazakhstan. The internal processes to obtain the sovereign guarantee for this project have not yet finalized. Thus, the legal agreements for the Tranche 3 loan have not been executed to date and, accordingly, the loan has not yet been declared effective. Given the deteriorating conditions for SME financing, Damu has requested $98 million additional financing for Tranche 3, bringing the overall Tranche amount to $228 million. Deposit dollarization has continued rising, going from 46% at the end of September 2014 to over 56% at the end of January 2015 fueled by fears of a new currency devaluation against the backdrop of the Russian crisis. Commercial banks continue to have a shortage of tenge liquidity and have stopped lending in local currency to SMEs.

"Work insertion of refugee Sahrawi young people through vocational training, microcredits and cooperatives.","WORK INSERTION OF REFUGEE SAHRAWI YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH VOCATIONAL TRAINING, MICROCREDITS AND COOPERATIVES.","&quot,El proyecto Â¿InserciÃ³n laboral de jÃ³venes saharauis refugiada/os a travÃ©s de la formaciÃ³n ocupacional, los microcrÃ©ditos y las cooperativasÂ¿ tiene como objetivo especÃ­fico aumentar, a travÃ©s de la planificaciÃ³n para el empleo, el nÃºmero de hombres y mujeres jÃ³venes que sobrevive en el refugio saharaui con una ocupaciÃ³n laboral digna y adaptada a sus respectivas necesidades prÃ¡cticas y estratÃ©gicas. Los y las jÃ³venes representan aproximadamente el 60% de un total de 165.000 personas refugiadas en los campamentos saharauis, mÃ¡s de 200.000 si incluimos la poblaciÃ³n nÃ³mada que transita entre los campos y los territorios liberados. Dentro de ese porcentaje, dependiendo de las wilayas, el nÃºmero de mujeres oscila entre un 60 y un 71%, por lo que estamos hablando de un sector importante de poblaciÃ³n. La falta de voluntad internacional para resolver el conflicto, la crisis econÃ³mica, la inexistencia de oportunidades laborales y de desarrollo personal para la juventud refugiada, el asistencialismo como Ãºnica vÃ­a de supervivencia y la llegada de dinero a los campos no vinculada al trabajo, ha promovido comportamientos preocupantes entre lo/as jÃ³venes como la emigraciÃ³n masiva y la incipiente apariciÃ³n del fracaso escolar, la delincuencia o el consumo de drogas, y, en el caso especÃ­fico de las mujeres jÃ³venes, relegadas ante la situaciÃ³n a los cuidados, la elecciÃ³n del matrimonio como Ãºnica vÃ­a para desarrollar su proyecto vital. SegÃºn un diagnÃ³stico de UJSARIO de 2012, que alertÃ³ y movilizÃ³ a las autoridades locales a favor del desarrollo de polÃ­ticas juveniles de empleo, esta situaciÃ³n ha arrastrado a la juventud refugiada a la inadaptaciÃ³n social, trastornos psicolÃ³gicos, baja participaciÃ³n social y polÃ­tica, quiebra de valores culturales y problemas de identidad, a lo que se suman trabas especiales para la mujer joven relacionadas con el rol de gÃ©nero. La intervenciÃ³n propone mediante metodologÃ­as participativas e inclusivas, con enfoque de gÃ©nero y derechos, el fortalecimiento de estructuras, conocimientos y capacidades locales, desde la idiosincrasia saharaui y la realidad de los campamentos, y desarrolla estrategias de sostenibilidad para crear oportunidades laborales mÃ¡s allÃ¡ de la intervenciÃ³n. Para ello plantea medidas de fomento laboral con enfoque de gÃ©nero y derechos (diagnÃ³stico y planificaciÃ³n, creaciÃ³n de unidades de empleo, programas de orientaciÃ³n laboral y bolsa de trabajo), amplia los recursos locales para impulsar el empleo juvenil, a travÃ©s del asociacionismo (creaciÃ³n de redes de compra y comercializaciÃ³n, distintivo Â¿proyecto jovenÂ¿), el observatorio de oportunidades laborales, el foro de debate y la feria de las iniciativas econÃ³micas juveniles, y crea puestos de trabajo  mediante el acompaÃ±amiento y mentorizaciÃ³n de emprendedore/as que se autoemplean en pequeÃ±as empresas o cooperativas, financiadas vÃ­as microcrÃ©ditos y ayudas estructurales.&quot,",Yes,0.947341024875641

Improving treatment care and rehabilitation services for people with spinal cord injury in Western Nepal,IMPROVING TREATMENT CARE AND REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY IN WESTERN NEPAL,"Spinal cord injury treatment care and rehabilitation remain major unmet needs in Nepal. Many cases of SCI are caused by falls from heights from trees (from which farmers cut fodder for their stock) and building sites. Road traffic accidents have become the leading cause of SCI in recent years. Moreover in 2015 two devastating earthquakes hit Nepal followed by hundreds of aftershocks. Estimates of injured vary between 22000-100000 many of them also having SCI.The International Nepal Fellowship (INF) owned Green Pastures Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre (GPHRC) in Pokhara remains the only health facility outside Kathmandu Valley that is specialized in providing rehabilitation services to people with SCI. GPHRC provides services to the Western Development Region and through four INF clinics also to the Mid-Western Development Region - a total population of around 8.5 million people, in Pokhara and its surrounding areas 14 million. In the continuation phase the activities to improve rehabilitation services for people affected by SCI that were started in 2013-2016 project will partly remain the same. In addition GPHRC will start admitting SCI patients also in the acute phase straight after the trauma has happened. In many cases there is still a remarkable delay between acute trauma care and beginning rehabilitation. Too often delay leads to secondary complications (esp. pressure sores) that could be avoided with appropriate care. The hospital aims at becoming a holistic treatment and care centre for SCI patients covering acute phase trauma treatment and care (incl. operative fixation) physical and mental rehabilitation education of patients and carers home assesments and modifications prior to discharge income generating activities for the injured follow-up and in some cases scholarships for the children of SCI patients to ensure that they can continue to go to school even after injury of the main bread winner of the family. The project will be implemented by International Nepal Fellowship Nepal?s (INF/Nepal) Green Pastures Hospital and Rehabilitation Centre (GPHRC) in collaboration with INF?s Community Based Rehabilitation (CBR) programme.",Yes,0.946457922458649

Summary: Partly because of the civil war, young people in Sierra Leone have been maligned and marginalized. Attitudes are starting to change because of the active and valued role young people played in the Ebola outbreak. This project will give them a media platform to express themselves and tell their stories of achievement and success. Comic Relief funds will be used to produce a new youth radio show and documentaries made by and for young Sierra Leoneans. As a result of the project, a space will be created for the voices of young people in Sierra Leone to be heard more in the future with broadcasters and politicians increasingly recognizing the legitimacy of that voice.

Frontiers of Engineering for Development,FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING FOR DEVELOPMENT,"The World Health Organisation estimates that nearly 2 million people die in developing countries due to health issues that arise from inadequate housing (WHO, 2010). Similarly, the United Nations International Covenant of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, states that adequate housing is fundamental to improving living standards among poor and low-income households. Without adequate shelter, families lack security and are vulnerable to natural disasters and the chaos of civil conflict (UN,2010). These examples clearly illustrate the need for adequate housing and hence, scientific research into the development of cost-effective, sustainable housing for developing countries. The developed world is making significant progress in tackling this challenge however, in many other parts of the world, there is still a great need for low cost, robust and thermally comfortable housing. In addition to the adequate housing requirement, energy access, water and sanitation are still major problems in many rural communities.This project proposes to address some of these pressing issues by using a multidisciplinary approach in empowering local capacity to use new methods and locally engineered materials, in building, low cost, self-sufficient,  modular-homes.  The design of the homes will incorporate upcycled materials and local agricultural waste that would have been otherwise incinerated or dumped. For example, walls could be made of plastic bottles, and wall/floor boards could be a composite made from agricultural waste such as sugarcane, coconut shells and/or banana stems. The building will also incorporate Energy and water harvesting facilities. The multi-disciplinary nature of this project will ensure that structural, energy, aesthetic and economic performance of the building are optimized. The activities of the project will include  fabricating and testing  various composites materials manufactured from plastics and agricultural waste. It will also explore various options for integrating energy, water and sanitation measures.",Yes,0.903037965297699

The project seeks to contribute - in a small-scale - towards climate change adaption by promoting environmentally friendly and adaptable agricultural technics within the livehood projects and trainings of supported interest groups. The project is implemented by FRC field staff together with refugees. In implementation existing leadership structures within the settlement are utilised. The supported interest groups are mostly existing prior to the project and selected considering different vulnerabilities. The learning groups will be established for intrested and motivated participants. The facilitators are refugees selected by the communities and then trained in participatory methods and adult education by the project. The main beneficiaries are the members of those 30 groups involved â estimated 600-800 persons in them. Another immediate beneficiary group are 20-25 group facilitators receiving training. Other potential beneficiaries are the families of learners and facilitators and wider community. The key activities are 1) facilitators' training, 2) support for the development of the group livelihood activities as well as providing group specific thematic, literacy and language trainings, 3) providing training in literacy, languages and business skills combined with small-scale group livelihood projects, 4) supporting district adult education with training.",Yes,0.890897035598755

Multi-sectoral Action for Non-communicable Disease Prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa,MULTI-SECTORAL ACTION FOR NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PREVENTION IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA,"Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing a transition related to disease epidemics. The region now faces a 'double burden' of disease. Infectious diseases remain the primary cause of death, but there is clear evidence that the prevalence rates of the main non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their common risk factors are rising rapidly. NCDs are an important cause of premature mortality and morbidity under the age of 60 in sub-Saharan Africa. This is especially true among the poor, given their lack of access to proper care and medicine. Often, communicable diseases and NCDs co-exist in the same individual, one can increase the risk or impact of the other. Current projections indicate that by 2020, the largest increase in NCD deaths will occur in Africa. In September 2011, all United Nations member states signed the Political Declaration of the High Level Meeting on Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases. This declaration recognizes that NCDs are an important development issue that must be addressed through multi-sectoral action since many NCD determinants lie outside the health sector's influence. Multi-sectoral action refers to work involving different government departments using a whole-of-government approach, in collaboration with civil society organizations and the private sector, when relevant and appropriate. However, there is little evidence on the success of multi-sectoral action in low- and middle-income countries. This project aims to generate evidence and to gain a deeper understanding of the main factors influencing multi-sectoral action for NCD prevention in sub-Saharan Africa. Researchers will conduct a comparative case study involving five countries. In each country, a research team will generate robust evidence on the extent to which, and how, multi-sectoral action is used to formulate policies designed to implement the World Health Organization's 'Best Buys' - its recommended, most cost-effective interventions and policies. Researchers will study different contexts, with an emphasis on population-based interventions. During the four-year project, the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC) will offer research fellowships to five African scientists to conduct the case studies. They will receive training in policy analysis and case study methodology. The research team will engage with policymakers in each of the case-study countries to ensure uptake of the evidence generated.

The project running from 2017 to 2020 works in South Lalitpur which suffers from a low rate of public schools and was hard hit by the earthquakes in the spring 2015. This project builds on previous co-operation between Loo Niva and Interpedia with a new partnership with Patan CBR adding expertise in children with disabilities.Previous work aimed to contribute to strengthening efficient and effective school and local education governance mechanism in South Lalitpur.

Poor quality education, lack of parental awareness, inequality and poverty are root causes. This project will use regular sport for development sessions in schools to encourage school attendance and challenge gender inequality.

F.a: Adult education program for Ivorian refugees and Liberian communities,F.A: ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR IVORIAN REFUGEES AND LIBERIAN COMMUNITIES,"Widespread violence in Ivory Coast after 2010 elections forced over 170000 Ivorians to take refuge in Eastern Liberia. In the beginning of 2013 over 17000 registered refugees in Nimba County are placed in UNHCR camp in Bahn and in over 60 communities along the border area. There are no adult education programs catering for camp or community based refugees or host community dwellers whereby 70% of women and 42% of men are illiterate. The development of communities is also hindered by the lack of involvement of the population. Refugee influx has resulted in increased pressure on the resources and has the potential to increase conflicts in the border area. Similarly in the refugee camps conflicts between different groups are common. The overal objective of the project is to improve the capacities and social cohesion in Bahn refugee camp and eastern Nimba border communities. The project is expected to increase the literacy rate amongst the program population, bring about discussion on development issues amongst community members and refugee population, and encourage self-initiated development contributing to improved well-being. The project has human rights based approach enabling participation of refugees and community membes to planning and implementation of the activities. Majority of the participants will be women whose participation in decision making and development activities will increase due to improved self-esteem and communication skills. Existing inequalities are reduced by offering equal learning opportunies also to other marginalised groups. With literacy and other skills gained during the project participants capacity to adopt to changing climate will increase. The project will benefit 4400 adult learners (50% Ivorian refugees, 50% Liberians, est. 80% women), 200 community based facilitators, 1000 community literacy management committee members and their family members. The implementing partner is National Adult Education Association of Liberia whose presence in Nimba will be strengthened. Through community awareness and mobilization activities the target communities will be assisted in establishing community literacy management committees to manage the program locally. Locally selected high school graduates will be trained on literacy facilitation skills. Communities establish study circles of 20 learners which embark on 9 month basic adult education learning including literacy, numeracy, English or French, social and development topics.",Yes,0.821447849273682

Establishing a harmonized Reproductive Health Registry in Jordan to improve Maternal and Child Health,ESTABLISHING A HARMONIZED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REGISTRY IN JORDAN TO IMPROVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH,"This project seeks to improve the quality and timely collection and use of reproductive health data in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan by establishing a harmonized Reproductive Health Registry (hRHR). The dearth and lack of reliable data limits the ability to make informed decisions by health providers, planners and community members, which can influence the well-being of women and children. The proposed implementation research project involving the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and back to communities. Issues of expanding services to cover vulnerable and undercounted populations are central to the proposed implementation and related research activities. Given the high numbers of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. The project will also focus on strengthening the capacities of decision-makers at different levels of the health system and other sectors to use the data collected and analyzed through the registry. The project will apply mixed methods to conduct a situational analysis of existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use, develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization, strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes, develop a dashboard of data and related analysis, assess the quality, timeliness and reliability of data, and build capacities of researchers and decision-makers. The main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and interoperability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.  This proposal represents one of nine selected as a cohort of implementation research projects spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems).  The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada's new feminist international assistance policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development.",Yes,0.629925191402435

F.a: Non-formal training in support for refugees in Ayilo 1 & 2 and Nyumazi,F.A: NON-FORMAL TRAINING IN SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES IN AYILO 1 & 2 AND NYUMAZI,"Despite the peace negotiations the political and ethnic conflict in South Sudan continues and the number of refugees is increasing. The refugee outflow is projected to exceed 800,000 by the end of 2015. Children and women bear the brunt of the conflict: 70% of the refugees are children, and almost 80% of the refugee households are headed by women. It is estimated that some 35,000 South Sudanese children are unaccompanied or separated from their families. The number of South Sudanese refugees in Uganda was in the end of 2015 210,000 most of them settled in the Northern Uganda. The project's goal is to contribute towards poverty alleviation among the refugee population in Ayilo 1 & 2, and Nyumanzi Refugee Settlements and community members in neighbouring villages in Pakele, Dzaipi and Arinyapi sub-counties in Adjumani District in West Nile, Uganda. The specific objective is that Targeted beneficiaries â 70 % of them women â have acquired skills to become self-reliant in terms of improved literacy (either in local languages or in English) and life skills and active participation to their communities' development. This is done by offering functional literacy and English for adult refugees and supporting FAL for Ugandans. The improved educational level will contribute towards improved ability to analyse the environment, to increased self-esteem and capacity to actively take efforts to improve living conditions, which will gradually help refugees and Ugandans nearby to fight poverty. The project will also prepare refugees for repatriation in the future. The functionality is emphasised, essential skills needed for refugees to participate in the society and to operate confidently, effectively and independently in life are inclusive. Issues such as better health care and sanitation, improved nutrition, environmentally friendly practises, money transactions and savings, rights and responsibilities of refugees and women are essential part of curriculum. The project will run annually 50 to 70 learning groups, 40 - 50 for literacy and 10 - 20 for English. Annually the project trains 1400 - 1500 refugees and about 200 â 300 Ugandans literacy learners are helped with materials and training.",Yes,0.61500209569931

"F.a: Community, Family and Youth Wellbeing Development Programme","F.A: COMMUNITY, FAMILY AND YOUTH WELLBEING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME","Burundi experienced a brutal civil war which displaced more than a half million people. After a cease-fire about 600 000 refugees returned. Upon their return young people were excluded from education due to different education systems and different languages. Hunger is also a major problem in Burundi because of the land issues, as the conflict has destabilized food production. The farmers in Burundi lack access to new farming methods for increasing the food production. Especially young people, who have returned to their home country after the war, have difficulties in finding vocational education, employment and reintegration into the society because of language problems and poverty. Supporting the families' development towards financial independence and equipping churches' capacity to address the social problems in their communities is a sustainable solution in improvement of societal wellbeing in the country. Farmers and families are trained and assisted in food production and animal husbandry, and environmental protection. Food security and climate change policies have been ratified and put into practice through church partner's trained staff. Youth centres offer youth activities and vocational training. Fida partners with la CommunautÃ© des Eglises de PentecÃ´te au Burundi (CEPBU, The Community of Pentecostal Churches in Burundi).The project contributes to a sustainable impact to the wellbeing of communities, families and young people in Burundi through a just, safe and caring church. The purpose is empowered families and church relevantly addressing the needs of youth, and improving the food security for 600 families of Giharo and Bukemba by 2016. The youth social interventions (youth centres) will give thousands of youth a safe place to learn and develop their life and vocational skills. As a result, the well being of youth will be improved â whereby thousands of young people will be able to face challenges of employment in formal and informal sectors. The beneficiaries include children, youth, their families, farmers, and the whole communities through a long-term impact, when youth employment will be increased and food production improved.

EMR also receives support (project-, and core support) from a number of other donors. No forwarding of funds will take place with the support Sida contributes.EMR is a network of around 70 members consisting of civil society organizations from Europe and from the countries along the Mediterranean in the Middle East and North Africa, which work for democracy and human rights.EMR's work aims at influencing decision-makers in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in a positive direction regarding human rights and democracy. The work is specifically aimed at trying to influence EU institutions and ensuring that EU relations with the region are based on a human rights perspective.To achieve this, EMR is working to engage selected organizations in Europe and the Middle East that work with democracy and human rights, in regional and national networks, to create alliances and implement joint initiatives (for example campaigns) and exchange experiences on key issues which are relevant to the region.EMR supports selected organizations in their advocacy work towards the EU but also towards the UN and decision makers in Europe and the Middle East and North Africa. EMR works with, and builds the capacity of the organizations on networking, advocacy, monitoring and documentation of key issues regarding democracy and human rights.EMR members have jointly come up with thematic issues where there is a special added value with a regional approach and working methods. EMR has subsequently set up the working groups, Migrants and refugees' rights, Women's rights and gender equality, as well as a group on Economic and social rights. EMR also works through national working groups / solidarity groups where focus is on issues and processes in the specific country. Country-specific groups include Palestine, Tunisia, Syria, Algeria, Morocco and Turkey.The shrinking space for civil society in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region has become an increasingly important factor affecting the various thematic and national rights and democracy issues that EMR is working on. To protect and promote the opportunities for civil society work, promoting freedom of association and assembly will therefore be integrated into the work of the different working groups and in EMR's work overall but also within the regional civil society hub that EMR is establishing with other civil society networks.EMR's added value and strength are the experiences and knowledge available within the network, which is used to cross-fertilise and strengthen work at national-, and regional level.Sida has supported EMR since 2003 and since 2010 with core support. Other institutional donors include the Danish Foreign Ministry and the EU.In 2017, an external evaluation of the support was carried out confirming Sida's assessment that EMR's work achieves results.",Review,0.247382268309593

Supporting Transformation by Reducing Insecurity and Vulnerability with Economic Strengthening (STRIVE),SUPPORTING TRANSFORMATION BY REDUCING INSECURITY AND VULNERABILITY WITH ECONOMIC STRENGTHENING (STRIVE),"Supporting Transformation by Reducing Insecurity and Vulnerability with Economic Strengthening (STRIVE) focuses on strengthening economic security for vulnerable children. Conflict, extreme economic stress, natural disasters and the spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS contribute to the increasing number of orphans and other vulnerable children worldwide. These children have been the focus of innumerable programs that address their health, educational, psychosocial and security needs. While many programs provide excellent noneconomic support to such children, rarely do they adequately address the issue of economic insecurity. STRIVE identifies and demonstrates effective and sustainable ways to improve the economic circumstances of vulnerable children. Managed by FHI 360, STRIVE implements field projects that use an array of economic-strengthening approaches, ranging from savings-led finance to workforce development to value chain interventions. Coupled with a robust monitoring and evaluation framework and learning strategy, STRIVE tracks and documents the impact of interventions on children's economic (financial) and noneconomic (health, education and nutrition) well-being.",Review,0.236304089426994

Lumos,LUMOS,"Primary goal (Comic Relief): Children and young people at risk. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: An estimated 8 million children live in institutions or orphanages globally. More than 80% of these children are not orphans. The primary reason for admission is poverty, additional triggers such as war, disaster and disease compound the problem in different countries. Decades of research demonstrate that institutions severely harm the health and development of children. Most institutional placements are considerably more expensive than the support needed to keep a child safely in a family. In Haiti there are approximately 30,000 children in institutions and more than 80% have at least one living parent.  Lumos will work with the government of Haiti and a range of partners to design and implement a long-term strategy to replace all institutions for children with community based services and structures that prevent separation of children from their families. This will be done whilst simultaneously dismantling institutions and supporting children to return and remain in a safe environment with their families and communities.

Along with other donors, Canada's contribution seeks to cover the additional costs of providing formal education for Syrian children, thereby protecting the futures of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable refugee girls and boys. As with all pooled-fund projects, Canada is working in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Jordan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems, increase donor coordination and harmonization, and strengthen mutual accountability. This project also fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, which helps to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors./Ce projet aide le ministÃ¨re de l'Ãducation de la Jordanie Ã  mettre en Åuvre son engagement historique, qui consiste Ã  s'assurer que chaque enfant de la Jordanie suit une Ã©ducation formelle, peu importe sa nationalitÃ©.

Economic analysis of solid waste management and drainage for climate resilient cities in South Asia,ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT AND DRAINAGE FOR CLIMATE RESILIENT CITIES IN SOUTH ASIA,"Most fast-growing cities in South Asia face increased waterlogging and water contamination from improperly managed solid waste. Extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, are expected to further complicate the operation of water-supply, drainage, and sewerage infrastructure, making good solid waste management an important ingredient of climate resilience. Good solid waste management involves reducing volumes, improving collection, investing in drainage, replacing riverside and wetland dumping with engineered landfills, and identifying sustainable mechanisms to finance waste management. Research is needed to understand the potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on waste management, and to identify what changes may be needed in waste management operations, planning, and policy. This research project, implemented in collaboration with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, based in Kathmandu, Nepal, will undertake such research to increase climate resilience in three cities in South Asia: Bharatpur and Kawasoti in Nepal and Sylhet in Bangladesh. The project will inform management and policy decisions in the cities with improved evidence on and capacity to examine several key factors, including the solid waste drivers of water-logged drains and how these are likely to change with climate changes, efficacy and viability of different waste reduction approaches, including financial and infrastructure implications, and the use of GIS (global information systems) and drainage modeling for the future climate-smart planning of the city. The project will also study and pilot sustainable schemes for segregation and conversion of wastes into organic fertilizer/energy products for poor local communities using a cost-benefit analysis.Beyond the three cities, the research will reach out to a broader group of stakeholders to influence how cities think about and plan for waste management in the context of climate change. Research outputs include peer-reviewed publications, technical reports, and policy briefs.

The refugee situation in Kenya is protracted with more than 90% of refugees having lived all their lives in camps. The refugee status is not a permanent solution for refugees. Durable solutions - as globally understood - comprise of local integration in the host country, voluntary repatriation in the country of origin or resettlement to a third state. The number of Somali refugees being repatriated is significantly low, largely due to the pervasive insecurity in Somalia. Moreover, there are dwindling resettlement opportunities because many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept refugees for political reasons. One of the main avenues in which refugees can access local integration is through naturalization and/or acquisition of work permits. However, due to unfavorable policies which are related to the government linking refugee hosting to terrorism incidents and the general insecurity in Kenya as well as the pervasive hurdles for naturalization and access to work permits, the prospect of actualizing durable solutions through local integration in Kenya remains diminished. The linkage of hosting refugees to insecurity has led to xenophobic attitudes within the Kenyan society towards refugees and a range of abuses meted on refugees by security agents, including arbitrary arrests, extortion, torture and deportation.",Review,0.159798145294189

Strengthening West African Research Capacity on Security Issues:  Internships at the Institute for Security Studies,STRENGTHENING WEST AFRICAN RESEARCH CAPACITY ON SECURITY ISSUES:  INTERNSHIPS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR SECURITY STUDIES,"West Africa faces many security challenges, including civil wars and insurgencies. Internships for young West African scholars at a leading African  think tank will help to build a better understanding of the complex security challenges facing the region. Issues of governance, security, and justice are high on the agendas of many West African countries. In recent years, security challenges have included five full-scale civil wars, over 40 military coups d'Ã©tat, unconstitutional changes in regimes, and numerous long-term separatist or insurgent conflicts. Even though such conflicts have also led to processes of state reconstruction, many security-related challenges remain across the region. These include transnational crimes, a rise in religious extremism, difficult political transitions, fragile post-conflict situations, climate change, and natural disasters. Adding to these complexities are poorly governed migration and population movements, and governments with limited capacities to respond to such challenges.  This project responds to the region's lack of policy analysts and researchers in the areas of governance, security, and justice. The lead organization, the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), is a pan-African applied policy research institute that has been engaged in African human security and security policy matters since 1991. The ISS has a tradition of internships going back more than a decade. Over three years, 2 interns from West Africa will be hosted at ISS offices in Addis Ababa, Cape Town, and Dakar. They will undertake research and improve their research methodologies, as well as their ability to develop research tools and to translate research findings into tools for  policy debate and change. Their research topics will be those that ISS defines as priority issues and that align with IDRC's Governance, Security, and Justice program. The research will help build capacity among young francophone researchers in member countries of the Economic Community of West African States who are pursuing careers within human security areas that include arms control, conflict analysis, risk analysis, peace building, security, corruption, rule of law, governance, and transnational threats. Their work will inform debate among West African policymakers and stakeholders about democratic governance, security, and justice.",Review,0.156908363103867

The Swiss contribution in the amount of CHF 4 million covers the period from 2017 to 2021. Financial stability and financial inclusion are critical to long-term growth and development. As such, policy makers aim to expand financial services to previously unbanked populations and businesses, while regulating the financial sector in order to prevent asset bubbles and financial crises disrupting economic activity. Smart regulation and strong supervisory capacities allow to reduce trade-offs and maximize synergies between financial stability and inclusion.

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education). It is part of Senegal's National Child Protection Strategy (SNPE - 2013â2018) and the Program for Improvements to Quality, Equity and Transparency in Education (PAQUET â 2013â2025)./Ce projet vise Ã  amÃ©liorer le bien-Ãªtre des enfants de huit rÃ©gions du SÃ©nÃ©gal (Matam, SÃ©dhiou, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Kolda, KÃ©dougou, Tambacounda et Ziguinchor) et Ã  offrir aux enfants, dans le cadre de leur scolarisation, une protection adÃ©quate pour leur permettre de vivre et d'Ã©tudier dans des structures qui leur garantissent la sÃ©curitÃ© et leur donnent toutes les opportunitÃ©s de rÃ©ussite possibles.

EISP Support to Environmental infrastructure - Main phase/huvudfas,EISP SUPPORT TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE - MAIN PHASE/HUVUDFAS,"The proposed extension of EISP is the third and is assessed to be of high relevance for the completion of on-going investment projects but also for continued support to developing the project pipe-line. The first extension, of 10 MSEK, was done in July 2013 in order to up-scale activities and results (the cooperation was reviewed very positively in 2013). The second extension, with 4.9 MSEK, was done in December 2013 in order to enable acutely needed support to the preparations for the stabilization and extension of the Duboko regional landfill and the development of the environmental financial direction. The overall project objectives remain and the extension will have a specific focus on finalizing the infrastucture projects, developing proposals and technical documentation for new investment projects, continuing the support to capacity building and policy development and defining an implementation plan for future policy making.Experiences from EISP during 2010-2014 show an increasing need for strengthened competence and capacity within investment planning at central level and the work load at the Miinistry has increased over time. As a result of poor project planning capacity and few well prepared project proposals Serbia did not receive any funds from IPA 14 for environmental infrastructure (and not likely to receive for IPA 15 neither). The Ministry of environment, and particularly the Department for Project Management' (DPM), therefore needs strengthened capacity and competence in order to move the national project pipe-line forward in order not lose additional IPA support. Continued work on the revision of the national waste management strategy, further development of the environmental financial direction and review of the draft water management strategy are some of the prioritized policy issues during the extension.The infrastructure projects have been delayed due to different reasons but usually connected to poor knowledge and complicated political processes at the local level but also, to an extent, due to the floods during spring 2014. Five projects with a total value of approximately 60 MSEK are planned to be finalized during 2016. Four out of five projects have turned out to become more expensive than originally estimated (two only marginally more expensive). The Duboko regional waste landfill is a new project to EISP and was included due to the urgent need for preparations for the stabilization and extension of the landfill. The propsaI also includes support to initial preparations for at least two new investment projects, which projects will receive further support, for development of technical documentation, in a planned new Sida support (Priority Environmental Infrastructure for Development, PEID) with estimated start 2015.",Review,0.101926550269127

Early Childhood Development Programme 2017,EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME 2017,"This project aims to improve the design, quality and inclusiveness of public services in Lebanon in areas with large numbers of Syrian refugees. The arrival of over a million Syrians in Lebanon since 2011 has put enormous strain on economies and services, particularly in poor areas in cities such as Beirut, ZahlÃ© and Tripoli. Current approaches to planning in Lebanon are based on a top-down approach which does not reflect the changing circumstances of communities and which has forced increased reliance on an informal sector that is approaching its absorbing limit. In contrast to a top-down approach, this project begins by identifying the multiple forms of vulnerability, resilience and agency of both refugees and Lebanese hosts, and the ways in which people's experiences are structured by inequalities embedded in infrastructure and service provision. The project focuses on small research areas to produce fine-grained qualitative and ethnographic data in order to understand how people's concrete experiences link to larger policies and inequalities at the municipal and national levels.",Review,0.0928165763616562

Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project,URBAN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERY PROJECT,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) is one of the largest public-private partnerships (PPP) in the delivery of primary health care (PHC) in South Asia. The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005.  The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012.  A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II.  With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states).  Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.  According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.  Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor are as worse as those of the rural poor because of poorer living conditions, and limited urban PHC. Failure to provide urban PHC can have serious negative externalities - spread of communicable diseases, debilitating epidemics, reduction in economic productivity, among others.",Review,0.0835825651884079

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 24,000 children (12,240 girls and 11,760 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 80 school facilities (60 formal public schools and 20 daraas or Koranic schools), as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education).

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to affect indirectly 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education).

Project area and Country: Kamwenge district, Uganda 3. Project justification: In the Kamwenge district the poverty level at 77.8% is one of the highest in Uganda. The influx of Congolese refugees in Kamwenge has put significant pressure on social services in the district. The women in the project location areas (9 sub-counties) have the highest illiteracy rates (65%), work longer hours, produce most of the food consumed in households and are more vulnerable due to their limited access to cash income and resources such as land, which are largely controlled by men. Due to high illiteracy rates and lack of employment opportunities, women do not have the necessary incomes to address their and their family's needs and to break the vicious cycle of chronic poverty. 4. The main objective and expected results:The WINGS project will address the above-mentioned challenges and work with women, especially girls, from the nine sub-counties to increase their household income through savings and investment.The main objective of the project is to reduce household poverty for 75% of the targeted women so that they can meet their basic needs and are food secure by end of 2019. This will be accomplished through enhanced capacities of the 4800 VSLA members to accumulate savings, the targeted girls and women's improved skills in agricultural practices and in business management and entrepreneurship, as well as increased participation of women and girls in decision making in the targeted villages.5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 4,800 marginalized women and girlsDuty bearers: District Local leadership (Commercial Officer, Community Development Officers, Sub-county Chiefs, Chief Administrative officer), politicians and religious leaders.6.

It will provide insight into the conditions under which international land governance instruments can be used to hold public authorities more accountable. This, in turn, may help locals secure the right to food in sub-Saharan Africa. From rural to urban In 2007, the absolute number of people living in urban centres worldwide overtook the number of people living in rural areas for the first time ever. As a result, the international development community's attention is increasingly turning urban. Yet data from the United Nations indicates that three-quarters of sub-Saharan Africa's poor still live and work in the countryside. Effective access to, and ownership over, land and natural resources remains critically important for the rural poor in Africa to be able to build decent economic livelihoods and participate meaningfully in decisions that affect their lives. Movement to acquire land on a large scale Against this backdrop, food, fuel/energy, climate, and financial crises have converged. One of the most immediate and important implications is the revaluation of land as a scare resource. This reality has driven industries, governments, communities, and individuals to acquire land at a scale never witnessed before.

Income inequality is among the highest in the world and there are great regional disparities. 31% of the population live below the income poverty line the level of unemployment is at over 50% and 15% of the adult population has HIV/AIDS. Climate change is predicted to have negative impact on agricultural yields and water availability in Namibia due to droughts and increased temperatures. An estimated 70% of the population especially in rural areas depends on agrarian production for a portion of their income and/or livelihoods. Yet the agricultural sector only contributes 7.4 % of GDP and Namibia imports more than 50% of the cereals and horticultural products that it consumes. Small-scale farmers use traditional methods of production that are characterized by low productivity. This weakens the food security of the population.The project aims to improve the possibilities of small-scale farmers to adapt to the effects of climate change by developing testing and disseminating information on new climate-smart agricultural techniques in the rural areas of north Namibia. The immediate aim of the project is to build resilience and facilitate climate change adaptation in Kavango region through agricultural productivity increases improvements of water access and use and institutional strengthening. The project strives to achieve the following three results:1. Improve the food security and livelihood of 1 000 small-scale farmers and their families by improving agricultural productivity2. Improved and sustainable access to water through rainwater harvesting and micro-drip irrigation systems 3. Community and farm-level resilience improvement through institutional strengthening of small-scale farmers and community awareness raising and capacity buildingIn the project 1 000 small-scale farmers form agricultural associations called Farmers' Clubs each with 50 people to test and practice new agriculture techniques that conserve soil fertility and increase agricultural productivity on demonstration plots. The associations will also begin horticulture farming. The storing of agricultural produce will be improved the associations will practice small-scale processing and marketing of crops will be supported in an effort to improve food safety and livelihood in the families.,Review,0.0337804481387138

The investment will begin in Amman because the completion of the billion-dollar Disi water supply system from southern Jordan will result in a substantial increase in NRW losses in Amman and requires a sustained program to reduce these losses. The activity will later be expanded to Aqaba and Zarqa. Through the use of a Fixed Amount Reimbursment Agreement (FARA) mechanism with Miyahuna, the NRW Activity aims to assist Miyahuna in decreasing NRW that is lost through leakage, illegal use, or inaccurate billing in selected zones of Amman through detection, repair, and remediation projects, and collecting the baseline data for possible future public-private partnerships in continued repair, operations and maintenance of the system.

Strengthening Primary Health Care and Social Protection: Universal Coverage in Pakistan through Heartfile Health Financing,STRENGTHENING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL PROTECTION: UNIVERSAL COVERAGE IN PAKISTAN THROUGH HEARTFILE HEALTH FINANCING,"One of the poorest countries in the world, Pakistan has been afflicted by both societal turmoil and natural disasters during the past decade. The resulting decline of an already-frail economy has made inequalities even more prominent. This development has acutely affected the health sector, which bears the burden of care for the poorest and is suffering from an increasingly dire loss of public funding. In order to address the country's woefully inadequate system of health care for the poor, the Pakistani health policy think tank Heartfile has developed an innovative model of health financing. It consists in enrolling health facilities (mainly in the public sector) to join together in order to provide catastrophic health coverage to the poorest. The Heartfile Health Financing (HHF) model has a technology interface that assesses a patient's poverty status and verifies it through linkage with a national database. HHF has been working at the tertiary care level so far, but is intended to cover primary care as well. This grant will enable an assessment of how the present model can be scaled up the primary care level. Using interviews and group discussions from the beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of HHF, this assessment will help improve the model and adapt it to the primary care level. Ultimately the project aims at having HHF contribute to the goal of universal health coverage in Pakistan. The process of assessment in this project will include a significant component of capacity building for the organization's staff, particularly in the area of research. The provision of training in research methods and support for more formal training (such as doctoral training of staff) will help ensure that research systems are in-built and ongoing as HHF scales up to the primary care level.",Review,0.0208850596100092

Durante generaciones, la violencia contra las mujeres ha dividido familias y comunidades perjudicando el desarrollo social y econÃ³mico al no contar con el capital humano que supone la mitad de la poblaciÃ³n y que ha desplazado de la participaciÃ³n pÃºblica a las mujeres con lo que ello supone.

Institutional capacity building for urban and territorial planning.,INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING FOR URBAN AND TERRITORIAL PLANNING.,"La instauraciÃ³n del urbanismo neoliberal ha provocado una inversiÃ³n de valores, fomentando la desregulaciÃ³n y la expansiÃ³n ilimitada y permanente de la urbanizaciÃ³n. En la nueva era del confort, la ruptura de los lÃ­mites y el principio de la superabundancia, ha generado una nueva nociÃ³n de libertad vinculada al derecho de la movilidad infinita y al derroche energÃ©tico. La civilizaciÃ³n contemporÃ¡nea se encuentra inmersa en un periodo caracterizado por la inseguridad y la incertidumbre. Los procesos de globalizaciÃ³n y la crisis ecolÃ³gica y social han generado transformaciones en el contexto general, y tambiÃ©n sobre los paradigmas disciplinares del urbanismo moderno. Una de las transformaciones que ha provocado mÃ¡s perplejidad, asombro y desconcierto es la de nuestro espacio urbanizado. Aunque el espesor histÃ³rico de la ciudad tiene mÃ¡s de siete mil aÃ±os, es a partir de la segunda mitad del siglo XX cuando se produce un espectacular incremento del nÃºmero de sus habitantes, generando la transmutaciÃ³n de la sociedad rural en urbana. Esta concentraciÃ³n creciente ha provocado, la plasmaciÃ³n territorial de una gran contradicciÃ³n: los territorios mÃ¡s agresivo y caÃ³ticos del planeta son hoy el hogar de la mayorÃ­a de la poblaciÃ³n. El urbanismo moderno nacido para reequilibrar y compensar los desequilibrios que habÃ­a generado la ciudad industrial, pero basado en un modelo de crecimiento continuo y permanente, estÃ¡ en crisis y lo estÃ¡ desde dos impugnaciones opuestas: las planteadas desde las posiciones neoliberales y las propuestas desde los planteamientos ecologistas. El espacio pÃºblico deberÃ¡ recuperar su carÃ¡cter simbÃ³lico, convirtiÃ©ndose en el lugar en el que se ejerza la condiciÃ³n de ciudadano, y lo harÃ¡n en un nuevo escenario formado por la constituciÃ³n y continuidad de los espacios pÃºblicos, estructura bÃ¡sica para la formaciÃ³n del tercer paisaje. La situaciÃ³n obliga a replantear el futuro de las ciudades a partir de anÃ¡lisis y diagnÃ³sticos adecuados, con el objeto de convertirla de nuevo en una ciudad para la vida. La soluciÃ³n estÃ¡ en incrementar la racionalidad del sistema, disminuyendo las necesidades y aumento el rendimiento, porque resulta necesario diseÃ±a y construir modelos territoriales y urbanos que consuman menos recursos y contaminen menos, sin que disminuyan los niveles de calidad de vida. Para ello resulta imprescindible abordar la renovaciÃ³n de los instrumentos de planificaciÃ³n urbanÃ­stica, y reflexionar sobre algunas cuestiones urbanas y ciudadanas, desde la herencia que ofrece el urbanismo en su triple condiciÃ³n: estÃ©tico-formal, cientÃ­fico tÃ©cnico y como medio de transformaciÃ³n social. Se trata de crecer menos para crecer mejor, de reducir la insostenibilidad de la ciudad consolidada, transformÃ¡ndola mediante el reciclaje urbano. Los nuevos modelos deben considerar la ciudad existente como recurso, favoreciendo la optimizaciÃ³n del tejido construido mediante la implantaciÃ³n de nuevas propuestas de alojamiento, equipamiento y espacio pÃºb",Review,0.0179826822131872

COOPERATION BETWEEN COMMUNITY LEADERS & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION ON LOCAL LEVEL AND COPING WITH EFFECTS OF WAR,"The goal is to improve cooperation between the government and non-governmental sectors in the field of conflict resolution on the local level and coping with effects of war. It reflects the main objective of the call, which is  support of Ukraine in building functioning democratic state and improving the living conditions of its inhabitants . Ukrainian society has to cope with social conflicts that are result of reforms, as well as of the war in the East. Most of these conflicts are displayed on the level of municipalities, communities, and families. There are conflicts of national identity and future of the country, sometimes defined as conflicts East-West, conflicts between IDPs and the majority caused by lack of resources and missing integration program,conflicts between war combatants and their communities and families,conflicts related to economic reforms and resulting poverty and exclusion of some groups. These conflicts are hard to be solved in the national level. The government does not have capacities to do so. It is more effective and realistic to cope with them on the local level through participatory planning of community development. The project is relying on the network of community activists having years of successful work behind themselves and so the got trust of their fellow citizens.They will be bearers of changes together with representatives of local governments. We will focus on 3 cities (200-700 000 inhabitants) having potential to become good examples for others. The project contains: capacity building through trainings and consultations, financial support of common plans of the city development and small projects on conflict resolution, transfer of experience from Slovakia through internships and festivals of community activities.",Review,0.015989987179637

Frontiers of Engineering for Development,FRONTIERS OF ENGINEERING FOR DEVELOPMENT,"The quality of water for swimming, during Rio Olympic 2016, was discussed several times. Although, for the period of the Olympic, these issues were temporarily resolved but they alarmed Brazilian urban and water managers and planners about their severe water contamination challenges. SÃ£o Carlos is located on the geographic center of the SÃ£o Paulo state in Brazil. The city has an active industrial profile with important national and international industries and certain agricultural importance. Due to its increasing number of high technology industries, the city has been proclaimed The National Capital of Technology by Brazilian President in 2011. However, these fast growing urban development, industrialisation and agriculture have caused severe water and environmental contamination in the whole city. On the other hand, lack of efficient and appropriate wastewater treatment system have exacerbated the contamination challenges. These contaminations have put a great risk to the health and wellbeing of the people and aquatic ecosystems. Promotion of resilience to water quality stresses and crises is a necessity in Sao Carlos. This resilience promotion requires development and enhancement of the knowledge and capacities to manage the emerging challenges and risks. Currently, a detailed and integrated map of active and potential contaminators across the city, is lacking.  The long-term vision of this research is to contribute to resilience promotion in Sao Carlos by developing a dynamic information platform for water quality monitoring and assessment. The current research aims to initiate this long-term plan by developing an integrated GIS map of the contaminators and contaminated areas in Sao Carlos. These maps could be used for water quality spatial and temporal analysis. Also, they will enable the local and national decision makers to proactively respond to water contamination across the region. Furthermore, these maps could be used for integrated urban wastewater system asset management plans.",Review,0.0103912409394979

Repeated rounds of unsuccessful peace negotiations and frequent outbreaks of violence (most recently in mid-2014 and October 2015) have caused members of the Israeli and Palestinian political classes and the general publics to become highly skeptical that there exists a potential peace partner on the other side and that a compromise is achievable. Given these difficult circumstances it remains critical to ensuring the ongoing relevance of the two state solution. Accordingly, H.L. Education for peace (HELP) and the Peace Palestinian Coalition (PPC) aspire to stress the necessity of reaching a negotiated final Status agreement among Israeli and Palestinian decision makers and international stakeholders, and to raise awareness among the public.

Public-Private-People: Joint and Inclusive Effort Against Tuberculosis in Somalia,PUBLIC-PRIVATE-PEOPLE: JOINT AND INCLUSIVE EFFORT AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS IN SOMALIA,The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rather new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the private sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration with the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and participation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB culture services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to TB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The project will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.,Review,0.0087580131366849

Strengthening children's rights education in Southern Serbia,STRENGTHENING CHILDREN'S RIGHTS EDUCATION IN SOUTHERN SERBIA,"The project is intended to remedy the lack of awareness of human and children's rights and reinforce the importance of respect for those rights in parents, teachers, children and the general public in Southern Serbia. As schools put little emphasis on human rights issues, teachers lack the knowledge and skills as well as teaching materials to educate children and parents on the rights of the child. The population in these parts of Serbia is ethnically mixed, which frequently lead to mutual intolerance and discrimination. The project primarily focuses on designing and strengthening educational activities about human and children's rights, with a special emphasis on raising the awareness among children and their parents of these rights, with the help of specially trained primary and secondary school teachers in Southern Serbian towns (Aleksinac, NiÅ¡, Sokobanja, KnjaÅ¾evac, Pojate, etc.). To achieve these objectives, educational materials and training for teachers of primary and secondary schools and workshops for children and parents on this topic will be prepared. Emphasis will be given on the rights of children from vulnerable groups and migrant children. Implemented activities will raise awareness of children's and human rights for the children and for the parents who are settled in refugees / migrants centers in Serbia. The activities will strengthen mutual respect and tolerance and will encourage children to active citizenship.",Review,0.00603741873055697

Project: Identification of lead Leishmania proteasome inhibitors with activity in mouse model of visceral Leishmaniasis through biochemical proteasome HTS and follow up hit to lead medicinal chemistry. Grantee location: USA. Description: Leishmaniasis is a widespread parasitic disease with frequent epidemics in the Indian subcontinent, Africa, and Latin America. The disease is responsible for about forty thousand (40K) deaths each year, and substantial morbidity. In its most severe form, viscera/leishmaniasis (or kala azar), the disease is characterized by parasitic invasion of internal organs, and is almost always fatal if left untreated. Several drugs are available, but they suffer from multiple shortcomings such as toxicity, failure of treatment due to parasite resistance, and length and cost of treatment. A research team led by Dr. Frantisek Supek at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation, San Diego, have previously identified a novel drug target for treatment of visceral leishmaniasis, the parasite proteasome. Small molecules that selectively inhibiting this parasite enzyme have shown promise to cure not only leishmaniasis, but also other kinetoplastid infections - Chagas disease and sleeping sickness. The aim of the current project is to discover selective inhibitors of Leishmania proteasome by high throughput screening and to optimize identified scaffolds towards orally available small molecules with efficacy in mouse model of visceral leishmaniasis.

Conservative estimates indicate an average of over 250,000 ducks in the region during winter, mainly Blue-winged Teal, and up to 50,000 shorebirds. Recent studies have also revealed that the northern wetlands of the Yucatan Peninsula are wintering sites for 38 of the 41 shorebirds recorded for the Gulf of Mexico, including Piping Plover, Black-necked Stilt, Whimbrel, Long-billed Curlew, Red Knot, and Long-billed Dowitcher. However, disturbances caused by harbor construction and several hurricanes have reduced important mangrove and marine grassland habitat for these species.

University of Glasgow,UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW,"Programme: Senior Research Fellowship Basic. Project: The Science of Rabies Elimination. Grantee location: UK. Description: Rabies is a horrific, but vaccine-preventable disease that kills thousands of people every year in low-income countries. International agencies now advocate investment in rabies control and have set a 2030 target for global elimination. With regional programmes underway, the major research questions are now how to optimize rollout and impact, addressing challenges as elimination is approached. My fellowship aims to address these questions through synergistic research embedded within large-scale rabies control programmes around the world.Â Through a large-scale vaccination intervention in Tanzania I will test the hypothesis that rabies circulates at low incidence with spatial correlations in transmission curtailing outbreaks through localized susceptible depletion, and permitting co-circulation of genetically divergent lineages. I will pilot surveillance approaches to increase case detection, improve patient care, track the spread of infection and inform elimination programmes. The resulting data will be used to formulate and parametrizeÂ models to investigate strategies to rapidly control rabies, minimize incursion risks, and maintain disease freedom.Â A global network of scientists, policy-makers, and practitioners provides an enabling environment for my intervention-based research across intercontinental settings. Findings will therefore translate directly into policy at the highest level, delivering impact through timely transferrable insights to guide elimination efforts.",Review,0.00402818433940411

Political Transition and Religious Radicalization in Burma and Sri Lanka,POLITICAL TRANSITION AND RELIGIOUS RADICALIZATION IN BURMA AND SRI LANKA,"This project focuses on inter-religious tensions in post-military rule Burma and post-war Sri Lanka and how conflict patterns are affected by discourses that portray Islam as an expansionist force threatening Buddhism. In Burma anti-Muslim mobilization have in the recent years escalated. Anti-Muslim attacks has lead to large flows of refugees and Buddhist monks has led violent riots in defense of Buddhism directed against the country's Muslim minority. In Sri Lanka, following the end of thirty-year of war in 2009, the nascent post-war period has witnessed an upsurge of Buddhist radicalization and violence against religious sites and members of religious communities and emerged as a key challenge for post-war reconciliation. The tensions between Buddhist majorities and Muslim minorities pose a challenge to peace and security within these countries and in the region. This project thus seek to generate deeper understanding of the religious radicalisation that is taking place in the context of political transitions in Sri Lanka and Burma and the implications this have for conflict escalation that is likely to hamper the budding economic development, human security and democratic advancements in the these countries.",Review,0.003377785673365

"Integrated arbovirus management, prevention, and control workshop","INTEGRATED ARBOVIRUS MANAGEMENT, PREVENTION, AND CONTROL WORKSHOP","The Integrated arbovirus management, prevention, and control workshop in Vietnam brought together key local and regional stakeholders to discuss and define challenges, needs assessment, economic analysis, burden, and relevant operational and technical activities related to the integrated management, prevention, and control of emerging arboviruses. Arboviruses are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks, or other arthropods. They include encephalitis, dengue, and yellow fever. The timing is relevant, as many questions still remain following the outbreaks of Zika, dengue, and chikungunya in Latin America, and there are many more unanswered questions in the Asian context. Organized by Vietnam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, the workshop brought together participants from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam to focus on collaboration aimed at dengue and extend this to include other regionally relevant arboviruses. The workshop was held two days ahead of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) Dengue Day. Dengue Day aims to strengthen regional cooperation and secure commitment for efforts to control and prevent dengue in ASEAN Member States. The timing of the workshop allowed ASEAN participants to return and join Dengue Day activities in their countries and share the workshop outputs. The funding came from IDRC and Sanofi Pasteur, both organizations that support new knowledge generation and sharing to enhance integrated arbovirus interventions relevant to each country's context.

London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,LONDON SCHOOL OF HYGIENE & TROPICAL MEDICINE,"Programme: Sir Henry Dale Fellowship. Project: Immunity dynamics and epidemiology of cross-reactive pathogens. Grantee location: UK. Description: Infections such dengue fever, Zika and influenza generate a substantial public heath burden. It is therefore crucial to understand the biological mechanisms driving individual-level infection and immunity, and how these shape population-level epidemiological dynamics. However, such viruses can cross-react with antigenically similar pathogens, which makes it challenging to analyse immune responses and the implications for future outbreaks. This project aims to address this knowledge gap using a combination of novel mathematical methodology and empirical data. First, I plan to quantify the contribution of different biological mechanisms to observed antibody responses against arboviruses and influenza. In particular, I will combine a unique longitudinal study of dengue and Zika in Fiji with novel mathematical models to reconstruct individual infection histories, and examine potential interactions in immune responses to these viruses. The work will also generate statistical tools for next generation seroepidemiological study design. This will make it possible to perform power calculations when pathogen cross-react and/or assays lack sensitivity/specificity. Finally, I will investigate how herd immunity generated by prior infection history shapes the antigenic evolution of influenza and re-emergence of arbovirus strains. This will improve our understanding of pathogen invasion and potential for future outbreaks.",Review,0.00248040468432009

East African GEOHealth hub for preventing environmental and occupational health risks,EAST AFRICAN GEOHEALTH HUB FOR PREVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RISKS,"The burden of disease from environmental and occupational health hazards and climate change is a growing concern in eastern Africa. A significant portion of this burden is preventable, but most countries in the region lack the research capacity to analyze environmental health risks and assess policy implications. In addition, government infrastructure for environmental health monitoring, regulation, and enforcement is limited. To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health. The project is being implemented under the Global Environmental and Occupational Health initiative led by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health in collaboration with Canada's International Development Research Centre. The overall research component of the hub is led by Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University, Maasai Mara University and Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya, and the University of Rwanda.

Co-constructing a Sustainable Fisheries Future through TURF. A comparison between Vietnam and Chile,CO-CONSTRUCTING A SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES FUTURE THROUGH TURF. A COMPARISON BETWEEN VIETNAM AND CHILE,"Despite small-scale fisheries (SSF) contributing two-thirds of global catches for human consumption, they have been increasingly marginalized and dispossessed by large-scale fisheries (LSF), a phenomenon labeled, 'the global ocean grab'. This affects fishing communities, leading to resource scarcities, deprivation of livelihoods and environmental degradation. As a solution to confront these crises, Vietnam and Chile have embarked on introducing territorial use right for fisheries (TURF). TURF are collective action institutions with common management, harvest and income. We aim to compare TURF adoption in both countries, examining their pathways to re-construct towards a sustainable fisheries future. Despite the different material conditions and poverty rankings of Vietnam and Chile, their SSF belong to coastal vulnerable communities. Both countries offer an array of transformational dimensions to analyze how global and regional forces interact regarding SSF. We will work with coastal communities entitled with TURF, aiming to co-develop action plans to improve the functioning of TURF governance and enhance their access rights and benefits toward a sustainable redistribution of resources. Strengthening TURF access rights will enhance coastal livelihoods and development, and support coastal conservation.

No Organisation,NO ORGANISATION,"Programme: Public Engagement Fellowship. Project: Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellowship. Grantee location: Unknown. Description: Science and technology are rewriting our world at an ever faster pace, but the way journalists cover these topics has barely changed for decades.I want to re-engineer the kind of journalism that I, and science journalists worldwide, produce about science. I want to develop new, more thoughtful, more interactive journalism formats that raise the level of public conversation about scientific research and how it affects us.My vision is for this new type of journalism to empower audiences with scientific thinking, link research to their changing world and give them the tools to take control of their day-to-day lives. I want to use my time on the Fellowship to develop new ideas and methods, and then become the leading science journalist in delivering these new formats across TV, radio, print, digital and beyond.Journalists reach millions of people every day, and members of the public invite us into their homes to help understand the messy world around them. As critical friends of science, rather than cheerleaders, journalists have a valuable role in public engagement.But we need do it better, now more than ever. The rise of fake news and a growing distrust of expertise are both contributing to the so-called post-truth world. Scholarship and authority are under attack in many places where Enlightenment values once held sway. I want to develop a way of doing science-journalism that goes some way to counteract this damaging rise of distrust. For public health, this is especially critical - here, public trust and engagement is arguably as important as the scientific research endeavour itself.We should not be satisfied with simply broadcasting information about the latest discoveries. Re-engineering science journalism means moving away from standard newspaper, web or TV reports, and developing ways for people to get more deeply involved in the science. The new formats I want to develop might allow audiences to shape and evolve stories, or help journalists initiate dynamic conversations with - and between - members of the audience who might not normally interact. Working with with coders, theatre directors, filmmakers and journalists in other fields, I want to learn how to connect with new audiences and make a step-change in the type, impact and reach of my work.I see these new formats being used to tackle complex topics that have the most impact on our lives but which are knotty, under-reported or nowadays considered too complex to report in mainstream news outlets. Often, these are also the areas in which people who are not already science-savvy find themselves most viscerally connected to research, such as biomedicine, public health, antimicrobial resistance, mental health, climate change, consciousness, artificial intelligence, disease outbreaks or synthetic biology.One of the best ways to ensure that the benefits of scientific",Review,0.00162712531164289

"Conflict, Violence and Environmental Change: Investigating resource governance and legitimacy in transitional societies","CONFLICT, VIOLENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: INVESTIGATING RESOURCE GOVERNANCE AND LEGITIMACY IN TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES","This aim of this 4-year program is to probe the concerns raised by environmental change for conflict and violence and to understand how we can respond more effectively to them. It does so by tackling a question identified by the recent IPCC report as a crucial question, what produces conflict and violence in the face of environmental change? The proposed research therefore begins from the insight that environmental governance policies and programs are often a platform on which actors struggle over discourses, authority and responsibilities. More scientific scrutiny is required into how such struggles within policies and programs can erupt as flash points for conflict and violence, or alternatively, can open up pathways towards peace and reduced vulnerability. Drawing from the social sciences the program explores how climate change is linked to perceptions of and responses to those changes. The work focuses on changes in forest and water resources in 2 countries: Nepal and Kenya. The objectives are: 1. To better conceptualise the social-political processes through which changing forest and water resources become enrolled in crises of legitimacy, conflict and violence. To produce empirical evidence of how global environmental change manifests social-politically within two carefully selected countries on two continents: Asia (Nepal) and Africa (Kenya). 3. To generate insights into how governance mechanisms can be better designed to address environmental conflict and violence concerns in least developed countries. The outcome will be a concrete evaluation of how conflict and environmental change together create new vulnerabilities and points of empowerment for people and polities.",Review,0.00149178202264011

Basic Research on Political Developments and HR in Developing Nations,BASIC RESEARCH ON POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND HR IN DEVELOPING NATIONS,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the world's most important food crops providing 20 percent of all calories and protein to the human population. Emerging new races of the wheat stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) threaten wheat production primarily in East Africa, Middle East and Central Asia, but also the globally. Stem rust disease outbreaks in sensitive wheat may result in 100% reduction in yield, thus severely threaten food security. We have recently discovered and described a wheat-rye substitution line, 'SLU238', possessing a novel gene towards these emerging new races of the stem rust pathogen. We have transferred this novel gene (Sr59) to a Chinese Spring (CS) ph1b mutant wheat background through application of the breakage-fusion mechanism. Simultaneously, we also developed Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers that can differentiate the presence of this specific gene, thereby being useful in practical plant breeding. Still, our discovery of the Sr59 gene does not contribute to food security as the gene has not yet been transferred to locally adapted wheat material. Our aim with this proposal is to 1) transfer the Sr59 resistance gene into adapted wheat genotypes, 2) secure agronomic and quality performance of these genotypes, and 3) transfer this new wheat into local systems of genotype improvements and variety spreading to farmers within the different regions that this proposal target (East Africa, Middle East and Central Asia).",Review,0.00110267463605851
APT Action on Poverty,APT ACTION ON POVERTY,"Primary goal (Comic Relief): Trade, enterprise and employment. Related issues (Comic Relief): NULL. Summary: Camel milk is a source of food and income for the camel herders in dry, remote Garissa Kenya. Milk is not regularly available to consumers, especially when there are droughts, when camels have less to eat and lactate less. The safety and quality is not guaranteed either which puts people off. Hygiene standards practiced by the women traders and their processing centres are very rudimentary. The collection and delivery is not organised adding to waste and losses. The project helps all these players to make step-changes in their basic practices, leading to more milk being produced year round, more income, safety guarantees for consumers, better fed, healthier herder children and camels. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.
