Sida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  The support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida's ambition to increase our partner's predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.Sida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC's Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   Furthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project Strengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action, to NRC s internal work on  Digital Transformation  and to NRC's work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.Sida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms, the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXXNRC's target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced persons but also when relevant, host communities and returnees.

A novelty of the new agreement period is that three country-projects (Afghanistan, DR Congo and Myanmar) are offered multiyear financing as they are protracted crises with a need for preidictable finansing to secure necessary resources and ensure predictability and contextspecific impact.The SRC is part of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement made up of 190 Red Cross and Red Crescent national societies, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Federation (IFRC) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Sida provides support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement through two channels: the ICRC and the SRC. The SRC channels most of Sida s support to national societies, the IFRC and the ICRC and works in longterm partnership with forteen countries: Cameroon, DR Congo, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DPRK, Myanmar, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Ukraine. The SRC's strategic cooperation with partners within the movement - with other National Societies (NS), IFRC and the ICRC â is essential and gives the SRC the possibility to work at both global and local levels. The SRC is in addition considered to have systems, expertise and capacity to strengthen the local capacity of NS to predict and prevent disasters, as well as to contribute to rapid humanitarian assistance in sudden crises. The SRC has faced difficulties in demonstrating the humanitarian relevance of the Sida-funded programs as they are often situated between humanitarian action and long-term development. The SRC's new humanitarian strategy 2016-2019 does, however, put a greater focus on humanitarian operations and this new approach is reflected in the organisation's application 2017-2019. Several programmes with a long-term development focus have been removed in the application for funding from Sida, and new initiatives with a sharper humanitarian focus have been included, such as Yemen and Cameroon (programme targeting CAR refugees). It will be important to follow up on this positive direction towards a strengthened humanitarian relevance to the Sida-funded projects to ensure its continuation.Support planned for 2017 includes long-term programs in various fields such as health, disaster prevention, resilience, sanitation, organizational development, volunteer development and planning, monitoring, evaluation and results (PMER). The support also includes regional support to the IFRC's different cluster- and regional offices in Africa, Asia and MENA.

La principal vÃ­ctima de la guerra en Yemen estÃ¡ siendo la poblaciÃ³n civil. El aumento de la violencia ha perturbado millones de vidas, generando una gran cantidad de vÃ­ctimas y desplazamientos masivos en la regiÃ³n. MÃ¡s de 3,6 millones de personas estÃ¡n desplazadas internamente desde que estallÃ³ la crisis. Las necesidades humanitarias en todo Yemen siguen aumentando, impulsadas por un conflicto en curso que ha colapsado la economÃ­a, los servicios sociales paralizados y los medios de subsistencia gravemente perturbados. Al entrar en el quinto aÃ±o de conflicto, la crisis humanitaria en Yemen estÃ¡ considerada como la peor del mundo, con un porcentaje de personas que se enfrentan a la muerte, el hambre y la enfermedad mayor que en cualquier otro paÃ­s. El 80% de la poblaciÃ³n necesita algÃºn tipo de asistencia y protecciÃ³n, 20 millones de personas padecen inseguridad alimentaria y 14 millones de personas tienen necesidades humanitarias agudas. En 2020, se espera que Yemen siga sufriendo una economÃ­a devastada, el continuo desmoronamiento de las instituciones y servicios pÃºblicos, el diezmo de los recursos y la falta de instalaciones sanitarias y educativas. SegÃºn datos de la OIM, actualmente hay 3,6 millones de desplazados internos (607.865 hogares), asÃ­ como unos 1,28 millones de desplazados internos que han regresado a sus comunidades de origen (213.427 hogares), dispersos en 22 provincias de Yemen. Con el conflicto en curso y los ataques aÃ©reos que se siguen produciendo, la poblaciÃ³n total de desplazados internos ha aumentado en un 57% (2 millones de desplazados internos mÃ¡s respecto al aÃ±o anterior).  Es poco probable que las cifras disminuyan en 2020. Las cinco gobernaciones de Al-Hudaydah, Amanat Al Asimah, Hayya, Taiz y Saada acogen a mÃ¡s de la mitad de los 3,6 millones de desplazados internos. Alrededor del 63% de los desplazados internos (o 2,2 millones) proceden de las mismas cinco gobernaciones. La gobernaciÃ³n de Marib tiene la mayor poblaciÃ³n de desplazados internos, con 770.028 personas (128.338 hogares). Los siguientes lugares con mayor poblaciÃ³n de desplazados internos son Sads Ahdak, en la gobernaciÃ³n de Amanat Al Asimah, con 57.444 personas (9.574 hogares), y la ciudad de Amran, en la gobernaciÃ³n de Amran, con 53.226 personas (8.871 hogares).Al mismo tiempo, segÃºn los Ãºltimos datos registrados, Yemen acoge a unos 265.440 refugiados y 9.746 solicitantes de asilo, de los cuales unos 150.000 no estÃ¡n registrados.

A esta situaciÃ³n polÃ­tica inestable vino a sumarse, a comienzos de marzo, la crisis sanitaria provocada por la pandemia del COVID-19, y a finales de julio, las lluvias torrenciales e inundaciones acaecidas en numerosos estados, hasta comienzos de octubre de 2020. AdemÃ¡s de provocar la pÃ©rdida de los medios de vida de la poblaciÃ³n mÃ¡s vulnerable, estas lluvias han agravado sus condiciones de salud y su inseguridad alimentaria. SegÃºn la Oficina de la ONU para la CoordinaciÃ³n de Asuntos Humanitarios (OCHA), son ya mÃ¡s de 875.000 las personas afectadas por las inundaciones. Ahora que las aguas comienzan a retroceder, mÃ¡s de 10 millones de personas estÃ¡n expuestas a contraer enfermedades transmitidas por el agua y 4,5 millones de personas a enfermedades transmitidas por vectores.

A Clear Road Ahead- Developing a Combined Technological and Socio-Economic Approach to Freeing Affected Communities from Anti-Vehicle Landmines,A CLEAR ROAD AHEAD- DEVELOPING A COMBINED TECHNOLOGICAL AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC APPROACH TO FREEING AFFECTED COMMUNITIES FROM ANTI-VEHICLE LANDMINES,"Clearing landmines both saves and improves lives in numerous different ways. Demining can help a community access agricultural land, markets and food supply, schools, hospitals and other essential services, through the clearing of transportation links and routes. By clearing anti-personnel (AP) and anti-vehicle mines (AVMs) from roads and fields, people and communities are reconnected, and this can bring huge socio-economic benefits to developing countries where these are most needed. Clearing AVMs from roads can also be a prerequisite for other aid agencies and government services to access remote communities. It restores freedom of movement and fosters freedom from fear. However, efforts to clear roads and fields from the threat of landmines are complicated by two issues: 1) the slow speed of current demining approaches particularly for certain classes of landmine, and 2) the need to prioritise the order in which different areas and land types are cleared for maximum benefit in the shortest possible timeframe.   We propose a project to tackle both of these issues, creating a new technological tool for detecting landmines alongside a methodology for examining cultural, political, and socio-economic factors at the national, district, and even community levels. This approach can guarantee the deployment of the technology for the greatest possible benefit in the shortest possible time.  To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a combined strategy of this kind has been attempted. The particular target of the project is minimum-metal AVMs laid in roads and fields, which is a class of landmines that is very difficult to detect by other methods, and thus very slow and costly to clear. Beyond this synergistic approach, the project will benefit from the unique advantages of our proposed technology for the clearance of AVMs. This is because our sensor relies on a frequency-sensitive detection of the explosive material, which is contained in large quantities in anti-vehicle mines.  The sensor's underlying technology is based on a quadrupole resonance (QR) approach, which relies on a simple detection mechanism: a pulse or series of radiofrequency (RF) pulses is applied at a particular frequency for the explosives of interest, and the presence (or absence) of a return signal is sought. As with metal detectors, a specially-designed planar RF antenna is placed close to ground level and fed with a sequence of RF pulses at or close to the QR frequency of the explosive to be detected. The same antenna is then used to detect the weak signals emitted by the explosive following the excitation. The important difference from metal detection is that it is the actual explosive contained within the mine that is detected and not any feature of the mine (such as the casing or the trigger), so the false alarm rate is low. This is particularly important for humanitarian demining, which aims to clear most, if not all, of the landmines in the interrogated terra",Yes,0.991218507289886

Action Against Hunger: Humanitarian Support 2018-2020 - Action Against Hunger: Ãterbetalning 2021,ACTION AGAINST HUNGER: HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT 2018-2020 - ACTION AGAINST HUNGER: ÃTERBETALNING 2021,"At the beginning of 2018, 135 million people found themselves in a situation in which they will urgently need humanitarian assistance, and 815 million people â one in nine â still go to bed on an empty stomach each night. Each year Sida undertakes a humanitarian allocation process in which all on-going humanitarian crises are analyzed against a number of objective indicators (e.g. number of people in need), and where the partners most relevant to respond to identified needs in each specific crisis are selected. This is to ensure a real application of the humanitarian principles, and especially the principle of impartiality. The initial funding to Action Against Hunger (AAH) in 2018, which is being encompassed in this decision, is thus based on the Sida humanitarian allocation process that took place in late 2017. A three-year agreement is suggested to be signed with AAH, where additional contributions will be added to the agreement, subject to funds availability, governmental appropriations and Sida needs assessments. A three-year agreement does also allow for strategic multi-year projects, which will increase the possibility to reach durable solutions.For 2018, it is proposed that 180 MSEK is allocated to AAH for the implementation of activities in 18 countries and to support the Rapid Response Mechanism and the SMART Methodology. An additional 21 MSEK is added to the agreement, 13 MSEK and 8 MSEK for activities to be implemented in 2019 and 2020, respectively, which means that the total initial contribution to AAH amounts to 201 MSEK. For a detailed overview of the allocated support to AAH, please see Annex V (Budget summary) to the agreement.AAH is a non-profit organization, previously known as Action Contre La Faim (ACF), which is governed by the French Association Law of July 1, 1901. AAH was founded in 1979 with an explicit goal of responding to humanitarian emergencies, with a main focus on issues relating to malnutrition. The mission of AAH is to reduce and prevent hunger among the most vulnerable populations around the world. Its mandate is to save lives by eliminating hunger through preventing, detecting and treating malnutrition, and to address the underlying causes of hunger.",Yes,0.991104245185852

PERÃ :: A nivel global, la mayorÃ­a de paÃ­ses vienen siendo afectados por la pandemia del COVID-19. PerÃº es uno de los paÃ­ses de AmÃ©rica con mayor incidencia en la pandemia desde el mes de marzo 2020 cuando el Gobierno decretÃ³ una serie de medidas para mitigar el impacto del aislamiento social en la actividad econÃ³mica y en los ingresos de las familias, principalmente las de mayor vulnerabilidad y pobreza. Entre estas medidas, estÃ¡n la transferencia de 200 millones de soles a los  gobiernos locales distritales y provinciales, con la finalidad de adquirir y distribuir productos de primera necesidad para las familias y el otorgamiento de un bono de 380 soles para familias vulnerables que tienen trabajadores/as independientes e informales, entre otras medidas. A pesar de la importancia de estas medidas que permiten facilitar el acatamiento por parte de las familias de la cuarentena, el covid ha seguido avanzando por el paÃ­s, siendo Piura, junto con Lima, Lambayaque y Loreto quienes concentran el 82% de los casos. Territorialmente, el contagio estÃ¡ avanzado hacia las comunidades de la sierra de Piura, y especÃ­ficamente en el Corredor del Alto Piura, pues se han confirmado 220 casos en seis distritos, y es necesario garantizar que esto no se amplÃ­e pues las brechas de salud existentes no garantizan la atenciÃ³n y recuperaciÃ³n de las personas que contraigan el COVID-19: la RegiÃ³n de Piura sÃ³lo cuenta con 13 camas UCI y 7 ventiladores mecÃ¡nicos, a los que se suma el desabastecimiento de equipos de protecciÃ³n para el personal. Por su ubicaciÃ³n, el distrito de Buenos Aires juega un rol central en el control territorial de la propagaciÃ³n del Covid19, por lo que el proyecto se va a centrar aquÃ­, en 600 beneficiarios directos entre integrantes de las rondas campesinas y personal sanitario, con el objetivo de salvaguardar los derechos de la poblaciÃ³n de Buenos Aires y del corredor Alto Piura",Yes,0.991087138652802

"Humanitarian, Engineering and Energy for Displacement (HEED)","HUMANITARIAN, ENGINEERING AND ENERGY FOR DISPLACEMENT (HEED)","To address this global challenge call, a multi-sectorial consortium led by two UK Universities (Coventry University and the University of Oxford),  with an international civil society partner and developing country researchers (Practical Action) and an international sustainable energy and ICT social enterprise consultancy (Scene Connect), has been formed to provide original research on energy for displaced populations. The overarching aim of this proposal is the implementation of safe and sustainable energy solutions for lighting, electrification, cooking, heating and cooling, and water and sanitation that promotes development and improves wellbeing in displaced communities, and the associated ICT-based business processes that enable replication and scalability.   The consortium aims to deliver an innovative research programme to understand how the energy needs of displaced people can be met a safe, sustainable manner. The project seeks to provide research on energy needs in self-settlements, host communities and refugee camps, and understand how sustainable energy solutions can be delivered. Based on this evidence, the consortium will engage a range of energy stakeholders to design and implement sustainable energy solutions. The role of sustainable sources of energy in providing energy services for refugee protection is a critical area for innovation and scale-up. While the focus within refugee camps is often on solar energy (due to the advanced nature of this technology and the natural solar resource available in many developing countries), there are increasing opportunities for the use of renewable biomass and biogas, wind generators, micro-hydro, geothermal, LPG, and waste recycling. Similarly, renewable micro-grids and hybrid systems are often proposed as options for enabling flexible solutions that can be supplied quickly and efficiently in humanitarian emergencies. In addition, the feasibility and ability of low-cost, remote monitoring wireless systems to manage assets and pre-empt operations and maintenance issues of energy infrastructure require further investigation. Digital infrastructure could potentially be created to provide the private sector the assurance it requires to enter this market which has traditionally been the domain of humanitarian actors. All these scientific areas are worthy of research.   The programme of work will provide energy access to four displaced populations in Rwanda (Kigeme, Nyabiheke, Gihembe refugee camps) and Nepal (Tibet and Bhutan refugees and Kathmandu climate change refugees) and assess the impact of the provision of energy on people's lives against the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and create impact through scalability of the energy solutions. Through the program we aim to build capacity with partner countries and organisations. To deliver this, the progress and outputs of the project will be disseminated through the UNESCO UNITWIN Network in Humanitarian Engineering (in which Coventry Uni",Yes,0.990655601024628

Protection of the right to food of the Palestine refugee population of the Gaza Strip in the face of the Covid 19 pandemic,PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO FOOD OF THE PALESTINE REFUGEE POPULATION OF THE GAZA STRIP IN THE FACE OF THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC,"TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: ProtecciÃ³n del derecho a la alimentaciÃ³n de la poblaciÃ³n refugiada de palestina en la Franja de Gaza frente a la pandemia Covid 19. :: La crisis de la COVID-19 ha venido a agravar la inseguridad alimentaria de la poblaciÃ³n refugiada de Palestina en la Franja de Gaza, en situaciÃ³n de bloqueo e inestabilidad permanente. Gracias al reparto de ayuda alimentaria, el presente proyecto mejorarÃ¡ la seguridad alimentaria de las personas mÃ¡s vulnerables.  El proyecto se implementarÃ¡ en todas estas Ã¡reas a travÃ©s de los centros de distribuciÃ³n con los que cuenta UNRWA, si bien es posible que se priorice determinada zona en el momento en que se reciban los fondos. A fecha de redacciÃ³n de la presente propuesta UNRWA cuenta con 10 centros de distribuciÃ³n de ayuda alimentaria en Gaza. El bloqueo impuesto por Israel sobre la franja de Gaza desde hace trece aÃ±os ha dejado a la poblaciÃ³n en una situaciÃ³n de extrema vulnerabilidad, dificultando cada vez mÃ¡s la provisiÃ³n de bienes y suministros bÃ¡sicos para la poblaciÃ³n y destruyendo el tejido productivo de la zona. AdemÃ¡s, el largo bloqueo econÃ³mico y militar estÃ¡ directamente unido a un alarmante nivel de desempleo y a un grave debilitamiento de los sectores productivos principales como la pesca y la agricultura. En este contexto, los niveles de pobreza siguen aumentando, asÃ­ como la dependencia de los servicios de UNRWA.  AdemÃ¡s, la inestabilidad polÃ­tica en la zona y los frecuentes episodios de violencia aumentan la vulnerabilidad de la poblaciÃ³n. En ausencia de medios de vida y perspectivas de ingresos entre la poblaciÃ³n, la asistencia internacional se encarga de mantener unas condiciones de vida dignas. En Gaza, UNRWA brinda servicios a mÃ¡s de un millÃ³n y medio de personas refugiadas de Palestina y mantiene un programa de emergencia para ayudar a los mÃ¡s vulnerables. La dependencia abrumadora de los alimentos de emergencia y la asistencia en efectivo atestigua la profundidad de la crisis de la dignidad humana.   Desde 2018, la Agencia ha tenido que hacer frente a las consecuencias del cese de la ayuda de Estados Unidos, que era el principal donante de UNRWA con una contribuciÃ³n de 360 millones de dÃ³lares anuales.  Este recorte obligÃ³ a la Agencia a realizar diferentes recortes y reajustes e incluso, en algunos casos, a suprimir de forma provisional algunos programas, con graves consecuencias para la poblaciÃ³n beneficiaria. Al mismo tiempo, se han priorizado aquellas intervenciones que son mÃ¡s importantes para dicha poblaciÃ³n beneficiaria, como es el caso de la presente intervenciÃ³n.  La situaciÃ³n crÃ­tica creada por la pandemia de COVID19, que estÃ¡ teniendo un efecto aÃºn mÃ¡s desolador en aquellos paÃ­ses que eran mÃ¡s vulnerables antes de la misma.  Este es el caso de la Franja de Gaza, una de las zonas mÃ¡s densamente pobladas del mundo y con una situaciÃ³n previa a la pandemia que situaba a la poblaciÃ³n refugiada de Palestina entre las comunidades mÃ¡s vulnerables.

Hasta la fecha, la Franja de Gaza continÃºa en situaciÃ³n de crisis crÃ³nica. En las Ãºltimas semanas esta zona ha sido nuevamente objetivo de mÃºltiples ataques militares por parte de Israel causando no solo daÃ±os materiales sino tambiÃ©n bajas humanas,, afectado gravemente a la poblaciÃ³n civil. SegÃºn el Instituto Palestino de EstadÃ­stica (PBCS), el porcentaje de poblaciÃ³n en situaciÃ³n de pobreza en la Franja de Gaza se sitÃºa por encima del 80%. El desempleo alcano el 41 % en el 2015, tras la Guerra de Gaza del 2014. En este sentido las mujeres se presentan como el grupo mÃ¡s vulnerable con un 60% de desempleo frente a un 28% en los hombres. Las razones de esta situaciÃ³n son: la caÃ­da del comercio exterior, la fuerte imposiciÃ³n de restricciones a las exportaciones de Gaza, el daÃ±o severo al capital y a la infraestructura por los conflictos armados y el alto nivel de crecimiento de la poblaciÃ³n en Gaza, lo que resulta en una alta tasa de crecimiento de la fuerza laboral, pero no un aumento en las oportunidades laborales. Los servicios bÃ¡sicos como la electricidad y el agua se encuentran prÃ¡cticamente en desuso, por lo que se perciben un alto nivel de necesidad de atenciÃ³n a la salud de la poblaciÃ³n mÃ¡s vulnerable (niÃ±os/as y mujeres).Por los motivos reflejados, la intervenciÃ³n que se presenta se dirige a cubrir las necesidades bÃ¡sicas de atenciÃ³n y salud materno infantil integral a 90 mujeres embarazadas, sus 90 bebÃ©s neonatos, y sus 180 hijos/as menores de 5 aÃ±os, teniendo en cuenta que cada mujer en Palestina cuenta con 2 hijos/as de media. En Palestina no existe un sistema pÃºblico de salud comparable al modelo del Estado del Bienestar, por lo que el 45% del gasto sanitario proviene de pagos realizados por las familias, el 30,5% del gasto lo financia el gobierno, el 19% del gasto lo financian las ONG's. El PIB destinado al sector sanitario de Gaza del 10.7 %.Entre los problemas mÃ¡s serios que afectan a la poblaciÃ³n de mujeres embarazadas encontramos la anemia. La tasa de prevalencia de anemia entre las mujeres embarazadas es del 35,7%. Durante la gestaciÃ³n, el estado de salud de las madres influye en el desarrollo y crecimiento del bebe, pudiendo causar la mortalidad de los/as neonatos/as y menores de 5 aÃ±os. Es mÃ¡s, por cada 1.000 nacidos vivos, el nivel de muertes prematuras es de 19.3 en neonatos/as reciÃ©n nacidos y 31.8 en menores de 5 aÃ±os. Por otro lado se seÃ±ala la alta tasa de violencia basada en el gÃ©nero (VBG) que afecta a la poblaciÃ³n de mujeres Palestina, residentes en la Franja de Gaza.

Emergency Restoration of Yavan Water Conveyance System,EMERGENCY RESTORATION OF YAVAN WATER CONVEYANCE SYSTEM,"The Project will restore the water conveyance system in Gozimalik, Khodzhamaston, and Yavan rayons (districts) of Khatlon Region. The system was damaged in May 2001 by an earthquake that disrupted water supplies to 56,000 people and 65,000 livestock. In addition, irrigation water supplies to 11,724 hectares of arable land were disrupted. About 90 percent of the people served by the system live below the poverty line. The system was completed in 1968, and consists of a tunnel, an open canal of about 28 kilometers (km), and three inverted siphons with a total length of about 3 km that convey water through three valleys. The earthquake damaged one siphon, disrupting the water supply. The Government agencies took immediate action and within a month had laid temporary pipelines partly restoring water supply. The Project will restore water supply by installing permanent replacement works, and rehabilitate facilities that pose a threat, thus safeguarding against failure risks. The project works include construction of bypass canals for two siphons, replacement of the third for which topography does not allow construction of a bypass canal, and some works on the main canal and tunnel that are necessary for safe operation of the system",Yes,0.989985346794128

Strengthening the Capacity of Municipalities in the field of Migration and Refugee Response in Turkey,STRENGTHENING THE CAPACITY OF MUNICIPALITIES IN THE FIELD OF MIGRATION AND REFUGEE RESPONSE IN TURKEY,"Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees worldwide and more than 3.6 million Syrian refugees alone. As the conflict situation in Syria persists, interventions tackling the basic needs of (mainly) Syrian refugees in Turkey have shifted towards fostering social cohesion, which has become one of the most important components of Turkey's migration policy. Municipalities play an essential role in achieving social cohesion between refugees and host communities. However, they are insufficiently prepared to offer longterm solutions and do not have a systematic approach when it comes to providing services or assistance to refugees. The present project by the Association for Solidarity with Asylum Seekers and Migrants (ASAM) aims to strengthen municipalities' capacities to develop comprehensive responses to meet the needs of refugees from a rights-based approach. The project's outputs will be disseminated to a wide range of institutions, thus creating an opportunity to address the identified recommendations with relevant government and local authorities, NGOs and UN agencies.",Yes,0.989855289459229

Access to drinking water and sanitation for the Sudanese refugee population in Chad,ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION FOR THE SUDANESE REFUGEE POPULATION IN CHAD,"TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: Acceso agua potable y saneamiento para poblaciÃ³n refugiada sudanesa en Chad :: A fecha de 31 de diciembre de 2020 residen en Chad 366.340 refugiadas/os sudaneses, ubicados en los 13 campos y 1 asentamiento del Este del paÃ­s. En la zona del este del paÃ­s, el fortalecimiento de las relaciones entre Chad y SudÃ¡n llevÃ³ a una mejora de la seguridad. El despliegue conjunto de ambos paÃ­ses de una fuerza de vigilancia fronteriza ha impedido en gran medida las incursiones de grupos rebeldes. A pesar de ello, la mayorÃ­a de los/as refugiados/as sudaneses/as (la mayorÃ­a mujeres y niÃ±as/os) en Chad son reacios a retornar a sus lugares de origen debido a la inestabilidad que aÃºn reina en la actualidad en Darfur.  Uno de los principales problemas en cuanto al acceso a agua potable de calidad, es, no tanto la obtenciÃ³n de ciertos litros de agua por persona al dÃ­a, si no el almacenaje seguro de la cantidad de agua disponible. Por esta razÃ³n, tras el anÃ¡lisis de necesidades realizado en el aÃ±o 2020 se ha detectado la necesidad de llevar a cabo el reacondicionamiento de los tanques de reserva de agua en el campo de Djabal, donde segÃºn los Ãºltimos datos disponibles respecto a las pruebas de calidad del agua en lugares de recolecciÃ³n sin cloro muestran que solo un 56% de esas muestras han dado resultados seguros. Gracias al reacondicionamiento de 4 tanques, se podrÃ¡ almacenar de forma mÃ¡s segura el agua, evitando vectores y enfermedades en la poblaciÃ³n. El mantenimiento de la red de distribuciÃ³n en los campos requiere reemplazar constantemente piezas defectuosas tales como vÃ¡lvulas de apertura, grifos, tuberÃ­as de distribuciÃ³n y tuberÃ­as de descarga.  AsÃ­ mismo, es necesario efectuar la carga y descarga de los depÃ³sitos de combustible de las bombas y adquirir y distribuir las piezas de recambio necesarias para las propias bombas. Se ha identificado como una necesidad absoluta la instalaciÃ³n de 150 puntos de lavado de manos como respuesta esencial preventiva y de lucha contra la pandemia COVID-19 reduciendo las altas tasas de personas por grifo que existen en estos campos, evitando asÃ­ las aglomeraciones (otro de los puntos crÃ­ticos en la lucha contra el COVID-19).",Yes,0.989844799041748

Secondary Towns Integrated Flood Protection (Phase 2),SECONDARY TOWNS INTEGRATED FLOOD PROTECTION (PHASE 2),"The Project for integrated flood protection covers nine secondary towns in Bangladesh: Brahmanbaria, Gaibandha, Jamalpur, Kushtia, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Mymensingh, Rajshahi, and Sunamganj. The selected towns are prone to river flooding, river erosion, waterlogging, and flash floods. The poorer income groups, especially recently settled dwellers, are the most vulnerable to disaster.

Esta dependencia se ha visto agravada desde el aÃ±o 2015 con la reducciÃ³n del actual nivel de financiamiento en el reparto de alimentos: en diciembre de 2015 se dio una ruptura del stock de la leche que era distribuida por el PMA en las guarderÃ­as de los campamentos, lo que supuso una merma considerable en la ingesta de nutrientes de los niÃ±os y niÃ±as de estos centros. En octubre de 2016 el PMA se vio obligado a suspender parte de su asistencia alimentaria, debido al dÃ©ficit de financiaciÃ³n y, de nuevo, el 15 de mayo de 2017 el PMA tuvo que detener la distribuciÃ³n de productos nutritivos especializados para la prevenciÃ³n y el tratamiento de la anemia, el retraso del crecimiento y la malnutriciÃ³n entre miles de madres embarazadas, lactantes y sus hijos pequeÃ±os. El principal obstÃ¡culo para los agentes humanitarios sigue siendo la escasez de financiaciÃ³n, lo cual se teme se vea incrementado ante la actual pandemia de Covid, todo lo cual tiene severas consecuencias, sobre todo, en colectivos altamente vulnerables como la infancia: en 2019 el 50% de los niÃ±os/as menores de 5 aÃ±os tenÃ­a anemia, 28% malnutriciÃ³n crÃ³nica y un 8% padecÃ­a desnutriciÃ³n aguda. En este contexto el Programa de Desayunos Escolares entrega durante 9 meses a niÃ±as/os de entre 3 y 6 aÃ±os los valores energÃ©ticos y nutricionales necesarios para su completo desarrollo fÃ­sico e intelectual. La poblaciÃ³n beneficiaria es de 7.415 niÃ±as/os de entre 3 y 6 aÃ±os y el objetivo es ?Garantizar el correcto funcionamiento del Programa de Desayunos Escolares en 24 guarderÃ­as de los campamentos de refugiados saharauis?.",Yes,0.989467561244965

A pesar de lo anterior, inmediatamente despuÃ©s la apariciÃ³n del virus, y su catalogaciÃ³n como epidemia global, las autoridades saharauis constituimos una cÃ©lula de emergencia que se encarga de la elaboraciÃ³n y seguimiento de un plan general y otros sectoriales como respuesta inmediata. los resultados hasta la fecha fueron satisfactorios pero la gravedad de situaciÃ³n ha aumentado despuÃ©s de registrarse 25 casos en la segunda oleada de contagios. la implementaciÃ³n requiere como hemos citado anteriormente del apoyo y la solidaridad internacional.

El actual llamamiento fue lanzado el 4 de septiembre de 2020 y es una actualizaciÃ³n respecto a los llamamientos de marzo y mayo en lo referente a la evoluciÃ³n de la pandemia y su impacto, asÃ­ como de la estrategia de intervenciÃ³n y respuesta de UNRWA en las Ã¡reas de salud, hospitalizaciÃ³n, agua, saneamiento e higiene y educaciÃ³n.

A travÃ©s del llamamiento UNRWA solicita 94.6 millones de USD (17 millones en el caso de Siria) para cubrir sus operaciones humanitarias relacionadas con COVID-19 entre agosto y diciembre.

Humanitarian response to basic needs regarding the COVID-19 crisis of migrant population confined in six shelters,HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE TO BASIC NEEDS REGARDING THE COVID-19 CRISIS OF MIGRANT POPULATION CONFINED IN SIX SHELTERS,"Desde que se produjeron las primeras medidas (en muchos casos de autoprotecciÃ³n) en MÃ©xico frente a la pandemia del Covid 19, Save the Children ha implementado acciones para atender a los grupos mÃ¡s vulnerables y en particular la poblaciÃ³n infantil migrante y sus familias albergadas en ambas fronteras de MÃ©xico. En lo que se refiere a la frontera norte, se han establecido actividades remotas de educaciÃ³n en emergencias que estÃ¡n siendo probadas actualmente en dos albergues y se han distribuido kits de alimentaciÃ³n e higiene, como primera respuesta, con el apoyo de donantes como Acnur o ECHO. Durante estos meses, se ha identificado que, debido a la imposibilidad de que padres y madres salgan a trabajar (o la gran reducciÃ³n de ingresos ya que muchos trabajan en el mercado informal), la dieta de niÃ±os y niÃ±as depende enteramente de los recursos con los que cuente el albergue y en ese sentido, presenta carencias importantes. Los espacios aceptan donaciones en especie de alimentos provenientes de particulares, organizaciones de sociedad civil e instancias locales, pero Ã©stas son variables y en ocasiones, insuficientes para proveer de tres comidas nutritivas al dÃ­a para cada familia. Adicionalmente, las aportaciones usualmente son de alimentos no perecederos o altamente procesados. El acceso a estos alimentos se ve ademÃ¡s limitado por las condiciones e infraestructuras de los albergues: escaso espacio de almacenamiento y mal equipado, sin cadena de frÃ­o o con cadena de frÃ­o insuficiente a causa de la red elÃ©ctrica, expuestos  a plagas de roedores u otros que en otras ocasiones ya han arruinado los productos almacenados, lo que limita el acceso de la poblaciÃ³n migrante a insumos de alimentaciÃ³n frescos y nutritivos e implica un riesgo a medio plazo si las condiciones de movilidad y acceso al mercado informal se prolongan en el tiempo a causa de la pandemia C19. A travÃ©s del trabajo realizado por SC en los albergues y el contacto con las familias, se ha manifestado la necesidad de disponer de kits de higiene incluyendo elementos de protecciÃ³n personal frente al Covid19, asÃ­ como la falta de adopciÃ³n de medidas de protecciÃ³n personal por parte de los migrantes, agravadas por las condiciones de hacinamiento y la necesidad de tener que salir a buscar sustento al mercado informal. Los albergues tambiÃ©n han manifestado que existe una carencia de productos de limpieza para asegurar la correcta higiene colectiva en las instalaciones, que se ha incrementado como medida de prevenciÃ³n frente al COVID19. Este proyecto proveerÃ¡ a los albergues y las familias de insumos de limpieza y alimentaciÃ³n para asegurar la correcta nutriciÃ³n e higiene, especialmente de niÃ±os y niÃ±as.

Children constitute 55% of the refugee population in the camps and they continue to face serious protection risks with the most urgent issues including psychosocial distress, family separation, neglect, child labor, child marriage, sexual and physical violence, trafficking and sexual exploitation. Save the Children Sweden (SCS) has submitted a funding proposal for the project  Strengthening Resilience through Child-centered Programming . Under this project, Sweden will provide 48 590 000 SEK over two years (December 2018 - January 2021) for expanding child protection mechanisms in Rohingya camps and host communities in Cox's Bazar. In addition, SEK 200 000 will be allocated for follow-up and monitoring activities on behalf of the Embassy. The agreement partner is Save the Children Sweden (SCS). Implementing partners are Save the Children International (SCI) and the local NGO Prottyashi. The overall goal of the project is For refugee and host community children affected by the Rohingya refugee crisis to be protected from violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect through appropriate, integrated preventative and remedial interventions using a self-reliance lens. The project will be implemented in Ukhiya and Teknaf upazillas in Cox's Bazar in both the Rohingya camp and host communities. The intervention is important to delivering on the fifth result area of the Swedish Result Strategy with Bangladesh 2014-2020, addressing prevention of crisis, conflicts and disasters and increased resilience. Through the humanitarian, development and conflict prevention-nexus, the Swedish contribution aims to finding ways to respond to windows of opportunities for development funding to facilitate the transition from humanitarian relief actions to early recovery development interventions in the Rohingya protracted crisis. The intervention is designed to prevent and respond to violations of children's rights and will seek to identify links to result area 1 on human rights and democracy and to result area 3 on climate change/environment. This can include synergies with the Swedish support to Plan International on child marriage and with the Swedish support to UNICEF on WASH in Cox's Bazar. Also, the intervention underpins the Swedish contribution in Bangladesh to leaving no one behind linked to the Sustainable Development Goals agenda and it is aligned to child protection needs included in the UN's Joint Response Plan 2018 and 2019.",Yes,0.988481998443604

En 2019, Grecia se convirtiÃ³ en la principal puerta de entradas irregulares a Europa por el MediterrÃ¡neo.

"Child Health, Agriculture and Integrated Nutrition (CHAIN): a randomized trial to close the nutrient gap in rural Zimbabwe","CHILD HEALTH, AGRICULTURE AND INTEGRATED NUTRITION (CHAIN): A RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO CLOSE THE NUTRIENT GAP IN RURAL ZIMBABWE","Stunting (low height for a child's age) affects 155 million under-5 children around the world and leads to a higher risk of dying, poorer school performance and lower wages in adult life. Improving the quantity and quality of food for children under two years of age is the best approach we have to prevent stunting. We recently did a trial in rural Zimbabwe called SHINE, in which we showed that educating mothers about infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and giving the child a daily supplement (called Nutributter) to provide extra calories and vitamins, helped children grow taller. Despite this, many children still did not meet their daily nutrient requirements and over one-quarter remained stunted. In addition, the quantity of nutrients a child needs in developing countries is probably higher than in developed countries, because the gut is inflamed and less able to absorb nutrients. We therefore need to increase the nutrients children get and try to heal the gut, to help children grow better.   In this project, we will compare a new package of interventions against the SHINE approach, to see if we can close this nutrient gap. Almost 200 households with a 6-month-old child will be randomly allocated (like the flip of a coin) to receive the SHINE IYCF package (which we know reduces stunting) or the new package, which we call 'IYCF-plus'. Households receiving the SHINE IYCF package will receive 6 visits from a Village Health Worker to provide a series of lessons in how to feed a young child a healthy diet, including daily Nutributter. Households receiving the IYCF-plus package will receive an agriculture intervention and a more intensive feeding intervention. Families will receive three new varieties of crops (fortified maize, which is more resistant to drought and pests, moringa trees, which contain high amounts of protein, vitamins and calcium, and sugar beans, which contain easily digestible protein, zinc and iron) and will receive advice during planting and harvesting seasons. We hope this will increase the family's food availability, provide a more diverse range of food choices for the child and improve the nutrient content of the diet. The nutrients contained in these crops may also help the child's gut to heal, which should improve absorption of the food. Village Health Workers will visit households 12 times to give Nutributter and to provide more intensive messages about how to feed a young child, including use of the new crops. Families will also receive powdered versions of the crops that can immediately be used (for example, by adding to the child's porridge) before the family becomes self-sufficient by growing their own.  We will compare children in the IYCF and IYCF-plus groups at 18 months of age. The main outcome will be how many children in each group meet their daily nutrient requirements, using a detailed questionnaire that recalls and weighs all food the child ate in the previous day. We think that more children in the IYCF-plus",Yes,0.987500548362732

Promotion of an innovative and green slope protection system (GreenPro),PROMOTION OF AN INNOVATIVE AND GREEN SLOPE PROTECTION SYSTEM (GREENPRO),"Number and intensity of natural disasters have been increasing in mountainous countries like Nepal and Austria. In a developing country like Nepal, the intensity of natural disasters are even more due to weakly monitored infrastructure  development activities such as constructions of roads, buildings irrigation channels, telecommunication towers, hydropower projects etc. Almost every family living on hills and mountains is vulnerable to landslide, flood, debris flow and  earthquake induced landslides disasters. Due to increasing number of landslides incidents every year, it has become routine or customary to bear the loss of hundreds of lives and property worth millions of dollars due to landslides and  floods. In order to mitigate the human induced and rainfall triggered natural disasters, it is necessary to implement appropriate preventive and curative measures against slope failure, soil erosion and flooding. Soil nailing is an economical  and efficient reinforcement technique used as a remedial measure in unstable natural slopes or as retraining structure for excavated slopes. In comparison with other retaining protection structures, soil nailing permits to reduce the  excavated fill soil volume, saving construction materials and realization time. There are basically two concerns about the application of soil nailing, first is in its analysis and design and second is about the use of materials. In order to  make an innovative construction practice and to make it more cost effective, environment friendly and sustainable, a right choice of facing and an appropriate design of soil nails are very important. Regarding the analysis and design of soil  nails, several national codes or guidelines exist. But the role of facing elements in controlling the deformation of excavated front or the overall stability of slope is not yet completely understood (Sanvitale et al, 2013).The stiffness of  facing strongly influences the characteristics of tensile force distribution, such as for a slope of two lateral segments, the tensile force at the connection (nail head) of nail with facing, and the location of maximum traction on the  soil-nail-facing system. (Sanvitale et al, 2013). Most of the conventional soil nailing with shotcrete, precast concrete or metal facing elements are generally costly and do not offer a 'Green' slope. The flexible facing elements do offer  some possibilities to grow some plants on the slope but have some disadvantages e.g. bulging or punching at nail heads and are not suitable to control surface erosion and local shear failure. In the above context, the soil nailing system with  semi-flexible 3-dimensional galvanized steel mat (popular as KRISMERÂ® system in Europe) is a high-quality construction system which has proved itself one of the best solutions to stabilize slopes and embankments. Although, the functioning of  soil nailing with semi flexible 3D mat has been verified by different experiments and real site assessments, the act",Review,0.98660409450531

Emergency project for tropical storm Amanda and Covid-19 El Salvador,EMERGENCY PROJECT FOR TROPICAL STORM AMANDA AND COVID-19 EL SALVADOR,"TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: Proyecto de emergencias por tormenta tropical Amanda y Covid-19. El Salvador :: Las comunidades atendidas por ANADES en las zonas rurales de El Salvador (San JuliÃ¡n y Cuisnahuat) beneficiarias del proyecto, son particularmente vulnerables a los fenÃ³menos naturales basados en el clima debido a la topografÃ­a y la geografÃ­a de los patrones de asentamiento y la escasez de viviendas.Las familias han venido de una cuarentena desde el 21 de marzo, la mayorÃ­a sin empleo fijo que viven del dÃ­a a dÃ­a y no estÃ¡n percibiendo ingresos. En las comunidades rurales la mayorÃ­a tiene temor a salir ya que el ejÃ©rcito y la PolicÃ­a nacional civil estÃ¡n reprimiendo a jÃ³venes y a mujeres a que regresan a sus hogares si estÃ¡n en el campo. AdemÃ¡s, no hay transporte colectivo lo que les impide vender lo que cosechan. Con la reciente tormenta tropical ?Amanda? los cultivos se han daÃ±ado y esto agrava la situaciÃ³n de la seguridad alimentaria, son personas pobres en alto riesgo alimentario.Las inundaciones y los deslizamientos de tierra son particularmente difÃ­ciles debido a la erosiÃ³n del suelo y los impactos fÃ­sicos del cambio climÃ¡tico que han cambiado los patrones climÃ¡ticos. La capacidad de recuperaciÃ³n de estas comunidades ha sido particularmente difÃ­cil debido a los bloqueos en todo el paÃ­s y las restricciones de movimiento emprendidas por el gobierno salvadoreÃ±o en respuesta a COVID-19. El impacto negativo en los ingresos por las restricciones por COVID 19 ha aumentado la precariedad de las familias en las Ã¡reas donde trabaja ANADES, especialmente en las Ã¡reas de seguridad alimentaria. Si bien el gobierno proporcionÃ³ una pequeÃ±a transferencia de efectivo a las familias ($ 300) al comienzo de la epidemia y continÃºa con la distribuciÃ³n ocasional de alimentos, ambas formas de asistencia no son suficientes para reemplazar los ingresos y garantizar la seguridad alimentaria de las familias y no llegan a todas las familias.Las fuertes lluvias de Amanda causaron daÃ±os significativos en casas, huertos y tiendas de alimentos en las comunidades. Los promotores de jÃ³venes y agroecologÃ­a de ANADES, en discusiÃ³n con las lÃ­deres de la comunidad, han determinado que la asistencia alimentaria es la respuesta mÃ¡s adecuada a los continuos desafÃ­os que enfrentan estas comunidades exacerbadas por la tormenta tropical actual.El proyecto consiste en brindar alimentos para 98 familias muy vulnerables que han pedido medios de vida y capacidad para adquirir alimentos, la asistencia humanitaria conlleva una raciÃ³n de alimentos para subsanar la situaciÃ³n inmediata durante un mes. Esta acciÃ³n no representarÃ­a ningÃºn riesgo de dependencia, ya que, ANADES estÃ¡ trabajando en estas comunidades en soberanÃ­a alimentaria, tiene un plan de agroecologÃ­a, y el apoyo a dos cooperativas de mujeres, sin embargo, esta producciÃ³n lleva su tiempo.

"An AI enabled digital diagnosis, empowerment and participatory platformfor HFMD surveillance","AN AI ENABLED DIGITAL DIAGNOSIS, EMPOWERMENT AND PARTICIPATORY PLATFORMFOR HFMD SURVEILLANCE","The collaboration is to build research and innovation partnerships with Teesside University, KMUTT, and MU, Thailand. The aim of this new collaboration, grounded on this proposal, is to develop a long-term research and innovation capacity in Thailand, to improve quality of services and efficiency for sustainable healthcare solutions. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a significant public health issue in Thailand where a real-time diagnosis and comprehensive HFMD surveillance system is not available [1]. Importantly, clinically-based surveillance systems are generally expensive, and unable to report collected information on time. In this context, participatory surveillance has a potential solution to complement/improve existing HFMD surveillance systems [2,3]. The aim of this project is to design and develop an AI (artificial intelligence) enabled mobile app for diagnosis, learning tool to empower users and participatory surveillance system for HFMD in Thailand. The system design and development will follow a two steps process. Firstly, HFMD data will be gathered from Thailand Bureau of Epidemiology (BoE), CDC and WHO, which will be analysed to develop a model for HFMD. The model will be tested and tuned with the gathered data. Finally, it will design and develop a participatory platform that consists of (i) a mobile app to diagnose in real-time empower the users based on the needs, (ii) collect HFMD-related data and report this data to (iii) an application server that will process, analyse and visualise the data, and share with the concerned stakeholders for necessary actions. The proposed platform will collect data that could be predictive of a HFMD outbreak such as that entered by healthcare people or those of certain meteorological attributes found to be correlated with the HFMD outbreak [2] and will detect HFMD using sign and symptoms information( e.g.,images). Also, it will aid the complete understanding of the transmission and persistence of HFMD.",Yes,0.984159648418427

[Philippines] Catchment susceptibility to hydrometeorological events: sediment flux and geomorphic change as drivers of flood risk in the Philippines,[PHILIPPINES] CATCHMENT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL EVENTS: SEDIMENT FLUX AND GEOMORPHIC CHANGE AS DRIVERS OF FLOOD RISK IN THE PHILIPPINES,"River morphology results from sediment transport and sedimentation, which are both a consequence of water flow. Episodic variation in natural (e.g. typhoons, earthquakes, volcanoes) and anthropogenic (e.g. gravel mining, river bank protection) sediment supply drives changes in riverbed levels and sedimentology. These changes determine channel capacity and flow routing, and thus associated flood risk to people and property. The same factors determine variations in lateral bank erosion rates, elevated rates result in the loss of developed floodplain and the failure of critical infrastructure such as road bridges. Despite the significance of variation in riverbed levels and channel position for flood risk, geomorphological processes are commonly overlooked in flood risk mapping. In the Philippines, rivers are particularly dynamic, risks arising from sedimentation and erosion need to be assessed and incorporated into flood risk management to mitigate the impact of flooding on welfare and the economy.   This project aims to: (i) develop a national-scale catchment characteristics database, and associated river geometry relations, to assess the susceptibility of different catchments to morphological change impacts on flood hazard, and (ii) assess flood hazards arising from morphological change associated with variations in sediment supply and the influence of lateral constraints on channel morphological adjustment. To achieve the first aim we will use national scale topographic models and repeat satellite imagery to assess fluvial and landscape characteristics to identify indicators of enhanced channel mobility and sediment transport, with outputs available from a river centreline Geographic Information System with data points every 1 km along the Philippines river network. This national scale dataset will be used by project partners to assess and plan infrastructure developments. To achieve the second aim we will generate repeat, high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the Pinacanauan de Ilagan River and the Bacarra Rivers, from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and bathymetric surveys. We will difference these DEMs to map patterns of erosion and deposition during a wet season, and calculate a sediment budget for each river. The DEMs and sediment budget will then be used to parameterise and assess hydro- and morpho-dynamic models that will be used to investigate changes in flood risk due to morphological change. This framework will be used, by project partners, to guide river and flood management in the Pinacanauan de Ilagan and the Bacarra catchments. The framework will also be transferable to other rivers in the Philippines, and farther afield in SE Asia and beyond.  This proposal forges a partnership between the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, the University of Glasgow, four Filipino project partners, and project partner Prof Brierley (University of Auckland).

Este propÃ³sito se garantizarÃ¡ mediante 3 componentes: aumento de la producciÃ³n agrÃ­cola con vocaciÃ³n de mercado local, incremento de los beneficios obtenidos de la venta de productos agrÃ­colas para las mujeres, fortalecimiento del liderazgo y el tejido asociativo de 661 mujeres relacionados con la comercializaciÃ³n de productos agroecolÃ³gicos en el departamento de Medina Yoro Foula en torno a la red ROPROCAS.El enfoque integral de desarrollo incorporado pretende, junto con la poblaciÃ³n destinaria, contribuir a crear un entorno social y organizativo favorable a la sostenibilidad en el tiempo de los medios de vida que se generarÃ¡n con el proyecto. Esto es, se impulsarÃ¡n estrategias productivas que reduzcan las desigualdades existentes y ayuden especialmente a las mujeres a generar ingresos de manera estable y sostenible. Paralelamente se trabajarÃ¡ por ampliar el margen de beneficio que obtienen las mujeres reforzando sus capacidades en el control de costes de producciÃ³n, ventas y fijaciÃ³n de precios, asÃ­ como potenciando su capacidad de venta con estrategias de conservaciÃ³n de productos fuera de temporada. Finalmente se trabajarÃ¡ en el refuerzo del tejido asociativo de las mujeres, reforzando su liderazgo, su marco organizacional y la conciliaciÃ³n de las actividades productivas y reproductivas con enfoque de masculinidades. La propuesta se centra en comunidades rurales afectadas por las restricciones ligadas a la crisis del COVID-19 y sus consecuencias en la seguridad alimentaria, debido principalmente a: reducciÃ³n de la disponibilidad de alimentos e insumos importados de otras regiones o paÃ­ses (especialmente Gambia), pÃ©rdida de productos destinados a la venta y reducciÃ³n de ingresos por limitaciones al movimiento. Se pretende dar una respuesta que tenga efectos en el largo plazo y refuerce la resiliencia para hacer frente a otras posibles crisis similares y/o relacionadas con alteraciones en el medio. Todos los resultados van encaminados a equilibrar las relaciones entre hombres y mujeres en las comunidades beneficiarias, para reducir la brecha de gÃ©nero identificada durante la formulaciÃ³n. AdemÃ¡s, se darÃ¡ visibilidad a las mujeres en los sectores productivos dirigidos a la generaciÃ³n y control de los ingresos.

En estos municipios Caritas de San Pedro Sula lleva desarrollando su quehacer institucional durante mÃ¡s de 50 aÃ±os a favor de poblaciones en estado de vulnerabilidad social y pobreza, a travÃ©s de intervenciones dirigidas hacia la promociÃ³n social, desarrollo socio-econÃ³mico y reconocimiento de sus derechos. Caritas cuenta con un alto grado de conocimiento de la problemÃ¡tica que afecta a las poblaciones en las comunidades y municipios del departamento de CortÃ©s, dada su presencia institucional en las comunidades y el trabajo desarrollado en coordinaciÃ³n y con el apoyo de lÃ­deres y lideresas de organizaciones sociales comunitarias (Patronatos, ComitÃ©s de desarrollo locales, Juntas de Agua, Asociaciones de Padres de familia, etc.), asÃ­ como con el apoyo del voluntariado (delegados/as de la Palabra y distintos profesionales voluntarios).

La gran mayorÃ­a de las familias evacuadas carecen de insumos de bioseguridad para la prevenciÃ³n y los albergues son un Ã¡mbito propicio para el contagio, por lo que se proporcionarÃ¡ informaciÃ³n e insumos para la prevenciÃ³n.  - Garantizar una alimentaciÃ³n mÃ­nima de emergencia para 2 meses a estas familias.  - Garantizar una atenciÃ³n sanitaria a colectivos especialmente vulnerables (menores de 5 aÃ±os y personas adultas mayores) para evitar un empeoramiento de su situaciÃ³n por el riesgo sanitario adicional generado por el huracÃ¡n.  - Facilitar a 40 familias q",Yes,0.981822609901428

DARE: Distributed Autonomous and Resilient Emergency Management System,DARE: DISTRIBUTED AUTONOMOUS AND RESILIENT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM,"Critical infrastructures serve as the pillars for the nation's economy, security and health programmes and include assets, systems, and networks spanning a significant breadth of the its geographical area. In the event of a potential destruction to these infrastructures by either man-made or natural disasters, it is of paramount importance to implement an appropriate emergency management system (EMS) capable of handling or preventing such catastrophes. A key feature in an EMS is an effective and efficient critical communication platform that provides situational awareness and coordination. However, the current communication platforms for EMS are susceptible to being incapacitated or destroyed by the disaster or the network congestion that arise as a result of such disaster. Furthermore, current platforms are human-in-the-loop based, requiring substantial human resources and cost for surveillance, preparation and actuation in case of emergencies.   In the light of this, the aim of the project is to conduct advanced research into a new Distributed Autonomous and Resilient EMS, referred here as DARE. The DARE architecture will support all phases of the EMS and will be founded upon three main communication platforms that are Wireless Sensor networks (WSNs), Ad-hoc networks and Future cellular networks (5G and beyond).   As part of this research project, we will incorporate an autonomous i.e. self-governed, self-healing disaster/network failure detection mechanism to reduce the cost of control signalling traffic associated with the traditional disaster/network failure detection mechanisms which require frequent network probes and network alarms. Investigators from the University of Surrey, University of Glasgow, Kingston University and the University of Malaya, Malaysia will work with leading communications and critical solutions provider like Ubitech Ltd, BT, Telefonica and Huawei to ensure that maximum impact arises from this program.",Yes,0.981664061546326

The Autonomy & Resilience Fund,THE AUTONOMY & RESILIENCE FUND,"We are delighted that the Dutch Postcode Lottery has approved our proposal to support an extra project to the tune of 1,380,000 euros! The proposal, for an Autonomy and Resilience Fund (ARF), was submitted by the Global Alliance for Green and Gender Action (GAGGA), which comprises the Fondo Centroamericano de Mujeres (FCAM), Mama Cash and Both ENDS. With the ARF, GAGGA works with Small Grants Funds to help local women's groups become resilient in a changing world in which it is increasingly difficult for them to hold their heads above water. The award of this large sum of money means an enormous boost for many women's organisations, and this is badly needed at a time when economic, climate and health crises are constantly putting the resilience of women, their communities and their living environments around the world to the test! The Autonomy and Resilience Fonds (ARF) was set up in May 2020 in response to the extra needs of women's groups and organisations worldwide resulting from the pandemic. Initially, the ARF mainly provided practical assistance â basic needs and protective equipment against COVID â to partner organisations and women's groups which we had already been working with for many years. Over the course of time, that focus expanded to embrace the slightly longer term and to strengthening women's resilience in a wider variety of areas. The small grants were used, for example, to provide training and meetings on personal safety, solidarity and communication, medical care, education and agro-ecology so that â despite the pandemic, which meant that many of them no longer had an income â women could ensure that they and their families could continue to eat healthily and safely. Because the ARF works with Small Grants Funds, which in turn have many contacts locally with all kinds of groups and civil society organisations, the money is provided exactly where it is really needed. Moreover, the recipients can spend the money as they best see fit, and it can be paid out quickly because there is no sluggish bureaucracy to hold things up. In May 2020, when the ARF had just been set up, within only six weeks 48 grants with a total value of â¬254,399 were provided to local environmental and women's groups in 21 countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and Europe. In the coming years we will use the extra contribution from the Dutch Postcode Lottery to continue to strengthen many more local women's groups in the same flexible way.",Yes,0.978742003440857

A diferencia de Cisjordania, la ocupaciÃ³n israelÃ­ de Gaza finalizÃ³ en 2005, cuando se desmantelaron los asentamientos israelÃ­es dentro de la Franja. A pesar de que este desmantelamiento supuso la retirada del ejÃ©rcito israelÃ­ del territorio gazatÃ­, Israel ha mantenido el control efectivo del territorio a travÃ©s de la intervenciÃ³n del espacio aÃ©reo, marÃ­timo y terrestre, al cual se suman diferentes ofensivas militares que han contribuido al deterioro de la situaciÃ³n de la Franja de Gaza hasta el presente. El bloqueo implica restricciones al movimiento de personas y mercancÃ­as de Gaza con otras zonas geogrÃ¡ficas, lo que limita el bienestar y desarrollo de sus habitantes. Debido a esta situaciÃ³n de bloqueo y a los enfrentamientos, la situaciÃ³n socioeconÃ³mica de la poblaciÃ³n  es de extremada fragilidad, con altos niveles de pobreza e inseguridad alimentaria. La inseguridad alimentaria en Gaza es muy alta, con casi un millÃ³n de personas dependiendo de la ayuda alimentaria proporcionada por UNRWA para hacer frente a sus necesidades alimentarias bÃ¡sicas. La Ãºltima gran amenaza a la maltrecha economÃ­a gazatÃ­ viene derivada de la pandemia global del COVID19 que puede tener consecuencias demoledoras. En este contexto, la situaciÃ³n de las mujeres en la franja de Gaza es de una mayor vulnerabilidad con respecto al resto de la poblaciÃ³n, puesto que la sociedad patriarcal ahonda en las dificultades y discriminaciÃ³n que ya de por sÃ­ sufren, siendo la violencia de gÃ©nero uno de los principales problemas. Este proyecto beneficiarÃ¡ a 1.961 personas refugiadas de Gaza (686 mujeres y 628 menores de 18 aÃ±os) con el objetivo de ?reducir la inseguridad alimentaria de las personas refugiadas de Palestina en la Franja de Gaza a travÃ©s de la distribuciÃ³n de cestas de alimentos?.",Yes,0.978126227855682

"Famines as Mass Atrocities: Reconsidering Violence, Memory and Justice in Relation to Hunger","FAMINES AS MASS ATROCITIES: RECONSIDERING VIOLENCE, MEMORY AND JUSTICE IN RELATION TO HUNGER","Hunger is on the rise globally. Although mass-starvation has killed staggering numbers of people, it is usually not conceptualized as mass-violence. Victims are rarely commemorated and actors responsible are not held accountable â despite the fact that famines are largely man-made. The proposed project aims to analyze the attempts and possibilities to pursue remembrance and justice after famines. It studies (1) under what conditions, how and by whom famines are understood, remembered and dealt with as mass-atrocities. This is done through a historical study of six famines in Africa, Asia and Europe. The project also analyzes (2) contemporary initiatives to push for remembrance and justice for hunger deaths, for instance by intergovernmental organizations, civil society groups, legal professionals, victim groups and states. Theoretically, the project understands conceptualizations of violence, memorialization and pursuit of justice as interconnected. Methodologically, the project will draw on earlier literature, archival research and media sources, and also carry out interviews with experts and key actors involved in projects ofÂ commemoration andÂ justice.Â Bringing attention to the structural violence of famines, and gaining a systematic understanding of the opportunities and obstacles to bring those responsible to justice and commemorate victims will contribute to the important endeavor of preventing famines in the future.",Yes,0.976818561553955

Subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support improved fiscal management and structural measures that will place the economy on a sustainable medium-term growth path.

Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project,GUANGXI WUZHOU URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,"Wuzhou city is a medium-sized city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou. The outcomes of the Project include improved environmental management through the enhanced disaster management and infrastructure and improved municipal services, particularly in the areas of wastewater management and solid waste management.",Yes,0.973655641078949

However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou. The outcomes of the Project include improved environmental management through the enhanced disaster management and infrastructure and improved municipal services, particularly in the areas of wastewater management and solid waste management.",Yes,0.973655641078949

The floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing 32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at $55 million. The Project aims to help Tajikistan address recurring flood risks through a holistic and coordinated approach involving both physical and non-physical measures in one of the most floodprone areas in the country - Hamadoni, Farkhor, Kulyab, and Vose districts in Khatlon province. A major part of the Project funds will be used for the physical works for the rehabilitation of 8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In addition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, strengthen flood warning systems, prepare a flood preparedness and evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by rehabilitating the hydrometeorological network. Given that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the possible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan were examined. The initial environment examination study found that there is unlikely to be significant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on ecological resources and socioeconomic conditions in the area. In addition, the project will help the Government define and implement the policy reforms needed to improve its flood preparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and maintenance (O&M) funding constraints for the flood levees and bank protection works.The Project will strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the local government bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to applyneed-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for the flood protection structures.

Provision of drinking water for the municipalities of Bersawa and Beristek,PROVISION OF DRINKING WATER FOR THE MUNICIPALITIES OF BERSAWA AND BERISTEK,"The project of construction of wells in the municipalities of Beristek and Bersawa reflects the critical situation with the lack of drinking water in the municipalities, which since 2014 have hosted a community of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who fled the terror of the so-called Islamic State / Deash. Despite the defeat of Daesh in 2017, Iraq is still in a phase of gradual reconstruction of the country, which is complicated by political, security, social and economic instability. In addition, the situation was greatly complicated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the decision of local authorities to gradually close the existing IDP camps, which are still inhabited by people who have nowhere to return because their homes and cities have been destroyed and they have no means to rebuild them. In the event of the closure of IDP camps, it is therefore highly likely that their inhabitants will seek refuge in the municipalities that have already adopted IDPs in the past, which will further increase the burden on their water infrastructure. The provision of drinking water in the municipalities of Beristek and Bersawa represents the creation of capacities for easy and stable access to sufficient drinking water for all inhabitants of the municipalities - including women, children and IDP communities (SDG 5). In the context of Iraq, which is severely affected by the lack of drinking water, municipalities will have the right conditions for their development and at the same time avoid possible tensions between the host and IDP community. At the same time the project includes anti-pandemic measures to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus, as well as training to protect water resources and the use of drinking water in the cultivation and breeding activities of the municipal population (SDG 13). Sufficient drinking water 'from the tap' will also reduce the production of waste in the form of disposable plastic packaging, in which the inhabitants of the village currently buy the missing drinking water (SDG 13).",Yes,0.971499443054199

Sexual and reproductive health and transactional sex in forced displacement: a comparative multi-country study,SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND TRANSACTIONAL SEX IN FORCED DISPLACEMENT: A COMPARATIVE MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY,"There is a significant gap in data concerning the patterns and drivers of transactional sex, sexual exploitation, and abuse in transactional sex and their implications on the sexual and reproductive health and rights of refugees.   Though shrouded in secrecy, transactional sex is widespread among forcibly displaced populations. Women, men (heterosexual and homosexual) and transgender refugees resort to transactional sex for various reasons, including to meet their basic needs, raise sufficient money to continue their journey, or in exchange for security. In most cases, refugees who engage in transactional sex are at greater risk of physical and sexual violence, mental health problems, unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and HIV/sexually transmitted infections. The silence and stigma around transactional sex â especially among young women â and the poor understanding of the role of gender relations as a driver hinder access to health services and rights to health, privacy, and freedom from violence and discrimination.  This comparative, multi-disciplinary, and multi-country research study will examine the gendered nature of transactional sex and the sexual and reproductive health and rights trajectories among refugee women, girls, and sexual minority persons, with the aim of developing appropriate interventions to improve policy and programmatic responses. The methodological approach will use ethnographic and qualitative methods in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey and will include preparing and piloting comparative quantitative surveys. The main analysis will describe the impact of transactional sex on sexual and reproductive health with a focus on needs and barriers to these services. This proposed research is part of a larger multi-country research program in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Sweden to examine the pattern and experiences of transactional sex and its sexual and reproductive health and rights implications across refugees' migration journeys originating in the Middle East, and in transit en route to desired safe destinations.  The study will generate unique evidence to inform public health policies and interventions addressing transactional sex in refugee populations.

Las revueltas sociales de 2018, la crisis econÃ³mica y la pandemia mundial del COVID han supuesto un incremento de la pobreza, difÃ­cil acceso a los servicios bÃ¡sicos y crisis a todos los niveles. En esta situaciÃ³n, las acciones de prevenciÃ³n de riesgos, promociÃ³n y educaciÃ³n para la salud, son prioritarias.En base a ello, este proyecto pretende, mediante acciones de formaciÃ³n e investigaciÃ³n, el desarrollo y la mejora de la calidad de vida en el municipio de Juigalpa (Nicaragua), por medio de la generaciÃ³n de capacidades y competencias socio-comunitarias en el Ã¡mbito de la EducaciÃ³n para la Salud para agentes sociales y lÃ­deres comunitarios.Nuestro anterior proyecto AACID posibilitÃ³ que el profesorado del FAREM-Chontales se formara en el Ã¡mbito de la docencia e investigaciÃ³n en EducaciÃ³n para la Salud. Ahora, estos docentes aplicarÃ¡n los resultados conseguidos, y capacitarÃ¡n a los agentes sociales por medio de cursos, seminarios, estudios e investigaciones, y otras acciones para formar a esos multiplicadores en aras de mejorar la calidad de vida y desarrollo comunitario del municipio.El proyecto es pertinente, se adecua a los intereses estratÃ©gicos de las personas destinatarias y de su contexto. Responde a los planes estratÃ©gicos de la UNAN-Managua (Plan de Desarrollo Institucional 2020-2029, Plan EstratÃ©gico Institucional 2020- 2024, PlanificaciÃ³n Operativa Anual Institucional de la UNAN-Managua). Se ha acotado el problema en el que actuar, con amplio trabajo de documentaciÃ³n previo y revisiÃ³n del estado de la cuestiÃ³n. Se ha definido para el contexto concreto de Juigalpa. Es viable (por la capacidad, experiencia y solvencia de la UNAN-Managua y del equipo), verificable (la propuesta es observable e investigable), coherente, orientado a conseguir los resultados esperados, sostenible, con claro beneficio comunitario, planteado para que sus resultados se mantengan en el tiempo y las acciones puedan tener continuidad cuando finalice el proyecto, de impacto demostrable.La contraparte ha intervenido activamente en la identificaciÃ³n y formulaciÃ³n de la intervenciÃ³n, asume las responsabilidades en la ejecuciÃ³n, aportando medios y recursos.

Click2Build: Leveraging digital transformation and modular precast construction to revolutionise future urban developments,CLICK2BUILD: LEVERAGING DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND MODULAR PRECAST CONSTRUCTION TO REVOLUTIONISE FUTURE URBAN DEVELOPMENTS,"With a population of 260m and rapidly growing, Indonesia is facing unprecedented challenges in affordable housing with an estimated backlog of over 5m in 2024. To address this pressing need, the Indonesian Government has  launched One Million Houses programme in the 2020-24 National Medium Term Development Plan. Vertical housing has become the preferred option in urban areas due to the lack of space and rapid rise in urbanisation, which often leads to  informal settlements and complex socio-economic problems. Despite the new initiative, however, new developments are unlikely to keep pace with the rising demand in vertical housing if local developers do not embrace new methods ofconstruction. The situation is exacerbated by the spread of Covid-19, forcing developers to implement much stricter health and safety protocols at their sites. Not only does this have the potential to lower productivity, but also increase the risk of cost and time overruns, making the 5-year national target even more difficult to achieve.The Click2Build project aims to make a paradigm shift in vertical housing construction by leveraging the potential of modular precast construction and digital technology. By integrating these two aspects, a cheaper and faster construction with a smaller carbon footprint than the traditional construction can be realised. The digital technology is introduced to  transform the industry and facilitate technology transfer with maximum impacts. Moreover, using the damage-tolerant precast elements developed in the previous UPP-SUD project, this project will create a unique opportunity to embed seismic resilience in vertical housing and hence alleviate hidden problems of poor site construction which can put  illions from a risk of harm during large earthquakes. The value of providing affordable urban housing to the low incomes is compelling, not only in terms of immediate economic benefits, but also in terms of the broader social dimensions in the longer term.",Yes,0.968471109867096

"West African One Health actions for understanding, preventing, and mitigating outbreaks","WEST AFRICAN ONE HEALTH ACTIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING, PREVENTING, AND MITIGATING OUTBREAKS","Human pressure on the environment and climate change have increased the possibility for multi-species contact, zoonosis (the transmission of disease between animals and humans), and the emergence of infectious pathogens and outbreaks. This includes Ebola virus disease and Lassa fever, which have created serious challenges in West Africa. Their recurrence poses multifaceted threats in the region, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts.   This project will accelerate and expand actions to prevent and mitigate infectious disease outbreaks at community and national levels across West Africa with a deeper knowledge of socio-ecological drivers, impacts, and solutions at the human-animal-environment interface. This is known as the One Health approach.  The research will be conducted in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia, and Nigeria by an international and multidisciplinary consortium. Gender-responsive, mixed methods will be used, including remote sensing, machine learning, and qualitative methods, to determine relationships between changing demographics, land-use patterns, and emerging pathogens. This will strengthen modelling and prediction of disease hotspots. It will also enrich understanding of the animal-human-animal transitional processes of disease emergence.   The research teams will describe and differentiate between the four countries regarding the impacts of COVID-19, Lassa fever, and Ebola virus disease on livelihoods, health systems, gender equality, ecosystems, socio-cultural practices, and food security. Gender-transformative community action groups will be developed to innovate with agricultural and social practices to monitor and mitigate against zoonoses and emerging pathogens. At the national level, the project aims to develop multisectoral, One Health governance structures that can develop environmental and agricultural policies to mitigate against disease emergence and transmission and related risks to food security and social inequities.",Yes,0.965638875961304

Applying Astronomy Capability to Map an Invasive Weed: Leveraging Satellite Surveys to Inform 'Famine Weed' Policy in Pakistan,APPLYING ASTRONOMY CAPABILITY TO MAP AN INVASIVE WEED: LEVERAGING SATELLITE SURVEYS TO INFORM 'FAMINE WEED' POLICY IN PAKISTAN,"It is projected that food demand will more than double by 2050 due to climate changes. The new generation of Earth observation data, including the Sentinel missions, offer the potential to identify and counteract crop yield declines. Astronomers are experts in analysing large multiband imaging surveys by making sense of the plethora of information using smaller targeted observations at high resolution and/or with spectroscopic information. This is exactly the expertise needed to utilise these new Earth observations to address global food security challenges. In this proposal, for the first time, we build crossover capabilities by focussing on a critical threat to two of the four most important crops in Pakistan (>75% of total output). Beyond the specific outputs of this project, this multi-disciplinary collaboration between astronomy, Earth observations and food security will also deliver transformative open-source tools. They will have secondary benefits to the UK in addressing global food security, and could be applied to challenges such as blackgrass in wheat. Furthermore they showcase the huge potential of STFC capabilities to contribute to tackling global challenges.  Food security in Pakistan is reliant on its ability to produce wheat and rice. A new invasive species of weed, the 'Famine Weed' (Parthenium hysterophorus), has been identified as a critical threat to agriculture and human prosperity in the region. Parthenium affects crop yields by as much as 90%, and has serious impacts on human and livestock health, and is therefore this project is of great importance to Pakistan. The University of Manchester and the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI) have joined forces to define a key challenge area for STFC research: the use of astronomy image analysis for mapping Parthenium across Pakistan. With their Islamabad office, CABI have over sixty years of on-the-ground experience in Pakistan and a proven track record of undertaking agricultural research projects in this region. Combined with the world-leading expertise in astronomy image analysis and optical instrumentation engineering at Manchester, we propose a four-stage project to provide detailed mapping of Parthenium in wheat and rice agriculture for the major arable regions of Pakistan.  Initially, we will aggregate and preprocess multispectral satellite imagery (WP1) and implement a campaign to collect high quality ground reference data (WP2) which is currently lacking. These will be combined to produce a computing framework for the detection of Parthenium in crops across the country. This will deliver static maps for the current extent of the weed (WP3) as well as a mechanism for future monitoring to be adopted by policy makers (WP4). We also place a strong emphasis on local academic capacity building through employment of local researchers, delivery of technical workshops, data hack challenge events and a researcher exchange program between Manchester and univers",Yes,0.961638271808624

Three geographical areas will be targeted by the project: Kananga (KasaÃ¯ Central), Butembo (Grand North Kivu), and Uvira (South Kivu), for a three (3) year project that will benefit 1,800 young people directly (50% women, 50% men) and 10,800 dependents and family members who will benefit economically from the training of their youth family members.The project will support young people s access to employment by connecting them to training centers, private businesses and mentoring and entrepreneurship opportunities. NRC will support the creation of an environment conducive to youth employment. This will involve filling knowledge gaps, providing practical training opportunitiesa and addressing the structural challenges that young people often face in getting a job or starting their own business.NRC will focus its efforts around three specific objectives:1. Young people develop and use fundamental, transferable and technical skills,2. Young people apply acquired skills in viable economic activities, 3. Education professionals have the knowledge and skills to provide quality training and support.NRC will implement this project in partnership with the Federation of Enterprises of Congo (FEC) and youth training centers (TVET) in Butembo, Uvira and Kananga. In addition, at the provincial level NRC will coordinate with the Division of Social Affairs (DIVAS), the Division of Youth (Divijeunesse) and the National Institute of Professional Preparation (INPP).",Yes,0.946965873241425

Healthy housing for the Displaced,HEALTHY HOUSING FOR THE DISPLACED,"Our vision is to transform the lives of displaced people encamped in extreme conditions through an engineered solution to housing that promotes a new science of shelter design. The project will entail research in five of the world's largest refugee camps. Zaatari and Azraq (Jordan), Kilis (Turkey), Mae La (Thailand), Nyarugusu (Tanzania). These have populations of up to 250,000 and hence are in many ways cities. They have summer temperatures >35degC and occasionally >40degC, in these conditions un-insulated dwellings are unable to provide safe conditions. In addition, such locations can have 1600W/m2 of solar radiation, further raising the temperature inside a dwelling, and in the case of Jordan winter temperatures of -10degC. In Thailand the high humidity is likely to be of equal importance in placing thermal stress on occupants. In addition, displacement shelters can use polymeric materials which contain a high proportion of VOCs such as plasticisers and release agents, and have poorly ventilated cooking facilities using fuels such as wood, thereby generating particulates.   Camps were once expected to be a short term solution, and this is still true in some settings. However, as witnessed in numerous locations around the globe, encampment often continues for years or decades (for example, the 340,000 strong Dadaab camp in Kenya opened in 1992).  Even in natural disasters delays in rebuilding can lead to displacement camps taking on aspects of semi-permanent settlement. The challenges of survival in the immediate onset of an emergency quickly give way to concerns about the suitability of shelter over a longer timeframe. Such basic dwellings inhibit domestic life, educational delivery to the young, and development of the social relations needed for community cohesion. Often the need of traumatised people for a sense of security and privacy also goes unmet. Unfortunately, even the state of the art in current shelter provision does not adequately consider building physics, thermal comfort and air quality. There is also a general lack of attention to socio-cultural issues. Thus, for example, our pilot study in Jordan has revealed through social surveys a consistent concern amongst the displaced population with the issues of safety and privacy.   Given the diversity of potentially available building materials, climates and cultures, there will be no single shelter solution, but rather a need for a systematic process of design that is cognisant of the climate, landscape, culture, length of time the accommodation might be needed, flexibility as family size changes and portability. This project will develop such a design process by creating a new science of shelter design through engagement with aid agency staff in four countries with diverse weather, cultural conditions and political sensitivities. This will involve 1) wide scale social and indoor environment surveys in five camps, 2) the construction of a series of potential designs in the UK, in a c",Yes,0.945392310619354

OECD Development Centre 2019-22 - OECD Development Centre - Cities Connect,OECD DEVELOPMENT CENTRE 2019-22 - OECD DEVELOPMENT CENTRE - CITIES CONNECT,"Sida intends to support, through co-financing from GLOBEC and GLOBEN, the OECD Development Centre with a total of SEK 40 million 2019-2022, divided into two projects focusing on developing aspects of informal economics (Tackling Vulnerability in the Informal Economy, TVIE) and with a focus on sustainable secondary cities (Cities Connect).This program will focus on the group that is mainly and permanently excluded from formal employment and which mainly involves people in high vulnerability and extreme poverty. Although much has been written about informality, the area is still underdeveloped and characterised by misinterpretation, which is probably due to the complexity of the informality. Informality is an area which has had a gaind importance within and on the activities of the OECD Development Centre and where Sida assesses the Development Centre can provide important contributions to increase the understanding of the root causes of informality and policy development in the field.      Within the framework of the strategy for Sweden s global development cooperation in the sustainable environment, sustainable climate and the sea, as well as the sustainable use of natural resources in 2018 â 2022 and its goals  sustainable cities and Societies , Cities Connect will focus on creating Conditions enabling secondary cities to be more efficient catalysts for sustainable urban development, poverty reduction, climate change management and resilience at local level. Their links to both major/capital cities and rural areas make secondary cities the key players in the environmental, economic and transformation process. These cities are increasingly going to play a key role in both climate adaptation and resilience-building strategies. As the population and built areas grow, energy needs will increase, while these cities are shifting to more carbon-intensive energy sources. Due to their strong links with rural areas and their dependence on primary economic activities, secondary cities will have to tackle issues such as climate-induced migration, floods, droughts, etc., as well as help capital cities mitigate environmental and socioeconomic problems. However, secondary cities face a number of binding problems that hinder their contribution to local and national development. These challenges arise from a rapid and chaotic urban expansion, which is aggravated by the lack of coordination between different levels of government, fragmented political systems and limited data and evidence for decision-making. In addition, sub-national authorities/local governmets are the first to face external negative shocks, including violent conflicts, unforeseen inflows of immigrants or refugees and more frequent natural disasters associated with climate change. Local authorities often have very limited mandates as well as poor capacities to implement policies and plans, making them heavily dependent on central government policies and financing decisions.

Programme funding,PROGRAMME FUNDING,The programme will be implemented in protracted refugee situations (Uganda and Ethiopia) and in a fragile country with forced displacement (Myanmar) with the aim of finding sustainable solutions for refugees returnees IDPs and host communities thus contributing to stability and peace. The beneficiaries participate in the implementation of the programme together with the staff of either implementing Partner Organisation or Finnish Refugee Council.The objective of strengthened resilience is achieved through a process of empowerment as right-holders get opportunities for education livelihoods and social participation. Their level of knowledge and skills livelihood opportunities and human security are important factors for the resilience of refugees. The programme will strengthen all these areas through tailor-made solutions for each region and target group. Lack of education and life skills are common causes of refugee vulnerability and poverty. Acquiring essential knowledge and skills (functional mother tongue literacy and numeracy language skills practical life skills) leads to a positive change in attitudes and self-esteem which is particularly important for the primary target group - those with intersectional vulnerabilities ? enabling their meaningful participation in social and economic life. In addition the rights-based approach and participatory way of working facilitates spreading out the benefits of the program fairly and equally. Supporting small-scale businesses and providing vocational training strengthens the economic potential of refugees. In addition to income generation support to climate-resistant agricultural enterprises improves adaptability to climate change. Human rights education with a particular focus on women's and PWD?s rights and the responsibilities of the duty-bearers raises awareness on the prevention of gender-based violence and strengthens the community security. Creating opportunities for the right-holders of different backgrounds to meet learn and discuss together (facilitated community dialogues mediation events peace committees) increases social contacts and understanding between groups thus contributing to the social cohesion and security of communities.

Livelihood Support and Women's Empowerment in Cox's Bazar/Soutien aux moyens de subsistance et renforcement du pouvoir des femmes Ã  Cox's Bazar,LIVELIHOOD SUPPORT AND WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT IN COX'S BAZAR/SOUTIEN AUX MOYENS DE SUBSISTANCE ET RENFORCEMENT DU POUVOIR DES FEMMES Ã COX'S BAZAR,"This project provides comprehensive livelihood support for communities, particularly women, girls and young adolescents, living in the host communities affected by the influx of over 740,000 displaced Rohingya people in  Cox's Bazar since August 2017. Cox's Bazar is one of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable districts, with the poverty rate well above the national average. Even before the influx, 33% of the host community population lived below the poverty line and 17% below the extreme poverty line. The arrival of the refugees has increased the supply of labour in the affected areas, driving down wages and increasing competition in the labour market, with a particular impact on the poorest host community households including those whose primary source of income is day labour. The influx has also put immense pressure on the availability and delivery of essential health services which were already scarce and overstretched. Women and girls, and women-headed households, are particularly vulnerable in this situation, including to gender-based violence which is likely to increase in times of economic stress.The project is designed to meet the immediate needs of the affected host communities in selected sub-districts in Cox's Bazar, while building skills, resilience and awareness to facilitate their long-term well-being. With a focus on empowering and girls, the objective is to lift the most affected host communities out of poverty through a program that combines livelihoods, social safety nets, financial inclusion and social integration. Activities include: providing grants and related support to ultra-poor women for income generation activities such as home gardening and poultry-rearing, , improving household food  consumption, employment-linked apprenticeship training for out-of-school youth and adolescents (male and female), facilitating production and retailing of traditional clothing materials by women artisans, and targeted training of community health workers and midwives to help address the essential health needs of the most vulnerable host communities. The activities are expected to directly benefit over 10,000 women and young adults and reach over 200,000 members of their households. / Ce projet vise Ã  offrir un soutien Ã  la subsistance complet aux personnes, en particulier les femmes, les filles et les adolescents, qui vivent dans les communautÃ©s hÃ´tes de Cox's Bazar touchÃ©es par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 Rohingyas dÃ©placÃ©s depuis aoÃ»t 2017. Cox's Bazar est un des districts les plus pauvres et les plus vulnÃ©rables du Bangladesh, le taux de pauvretÃ© y est beaucoup plus Ã©levÃ© que la moyenne nationale. MÃªme avant l'afflux des Rohingyas, 33 % de la population de ces communautÃ©s vivait sous le seuil de la pauvretÃ©, et 17 %, sous le seuil de l'extrÃªme pauvretÃ©.

International Detention Coalition: Core Contribution 2018 - 2021,INTERNATIONAL DETENTION COALITION: CORE CONTRIBUTION 2018 - 2021,"All over the world, a growing number of countries use administrative detention practices in response to migration and refugee movements, whereby foreigners, including children and minors - with their families or unaccompanied - as well as other vulnerable persons are detained based on their migration status, often without legal decision and for an unlimited period. The phenomenon has profound negative impacts on the lives of refugees and migrants worldwide. From a Human Security perspective, developing and implementing alternatives to detention (ATD) is therefore a key area of foreign policy engagement. International Detention Coalition (IDC) is a network of more than 400 non-governmental organizations, academics and practitioners. Through its unique member-network, IDC builds on growing international commitments to ATD in order to implement reform of detention practices tailored to the national contexts in several key countries in cooperation with civil society actors. IDC acts as a catalyst and facilitator of change, bringing together key stakeholders in order to develop shared strategies.

The activity is in support of the Agency's Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy and contributes to the Agency's objectives under Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD), and the Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS). The activity is part of the partnership USAID announced at the 2017 Global Nutrition Summit and builds on the Agency's strong history of investments in effective and scalable interventions that prevent and treat undernutrition. It will contribute to USAID's understanding of how to address poor nutrition in complex environments to strengthen resilience in areas of recurrent crises.

This package will be tested via a cluster-randomized control trial (cRCT), impact will be measured through key purchase, consumption, and behavior-related indicators.

Actualmente mÃ¡s de 104.000 refugiadas/os centroafricanas/os se encuentran en el Ã¡rea de GorÃ©, al sur de Chad.El agua y el saneamiento han sido uno de los mayores desafÃ­os para las organizaciones humanitarias. Gracias al trabajo de ACNUR y sus socios locales e internacionales, se han visto algunos avances en los 4 Ãºltimos aÃ±os en relaciÃ³n a la cantidad de agua por persona y dÃ­a en los campos de implementaciÃ³n del proyecto.A este respecto es necesario destacar que los 6 campos de ejecuciciÃ³n del proyecto cuentan con una cantidad de agua por persona al dÃ­a superior al estÃ¡ndar internacional (situado en 20L/P/D), pero para mantener estos buenos resultados continua siendo fundamental la inversiÃ³n de fondos en reparaciones, mantemientos, sustituciÃ³n por sistemas mÃ¡s novedosos y eficientes, etc.TambÃ­en es una prioridad no solo la cantidad de agua potable disponible, si no que esta sea de una calidad adecuada y para ello es necesario realizar controles y cloraciones de foma mÃ¡s habitual. En cuanto al saneamiento, el porcentaje de familias que dispone de letrina propia o compartida asciende al 68% de media en 6 campos de ejecuciÃ³n del proyecto, siendo en este caso el estÃ¡ndar mÃ­nimo humanitario igual o superior al 90%. Todo ello supone un aumento en la incidencia y transmisiÃ³n de enfermedades parasitarias, fÃºngicas o cutÃ¡neas, infecciones oculares, enfermedades diarreicas y la deshidrataciÃ³n asociada a las mismas, que especialmente en menores de 5 aÃ±os puede ser mortal.Es necesario que el nÃºmero de personas que dependen de un solo pozo o utilizan una misma letrina sea el menor posible, puesto que de esta forma se reduce la contaminaciÃ³n alrededor de los puntos de agua debido a los desechos y al agua estancada, se reducen tambiÃ©n las averÃ­as de las infraestructuras debido al uso continuado de las mismas, se reducen los tiempos de espera y, por tanto, los conflictos que se p",Yes,0.904766142368317

OECD Development Centre 2019-22,OECD DEVELOPMENT CENTRE 2019-22,"Sida intends to support, through co-financing from GLOBEC and GLOBEN, the OECD Development Centre with a total of SEK 40 million 2019-2022, divided into two projects focusing on developing aspects of informal economics (Tackling Vulnerability in the Informal Economy, TVIE) and with a focus on sustainable secondary cities (Cities Connect).This program will focus on the group that is mainly and permanently excluded from formal employment and which mainly involves people in high vulnerability and extreme poverty. Although much has been written about informality, the area is still underdeveloped and characterised by misinterpretation, which is probably due to the complexity of the informality. Informality is an area which has had a gaind importance within and on the activities of the OECD Development Centre and where Sida assesses the Development Centre can provide important contributions to increase the understanding of the root causes of informality and policy development in the field.      Within the framework of the strategy for Sweden s global development cooperation in the sustainable environment, sustainable climate and the sea, as well as the sustainable use of natural resources in 2018 â 2022 and its goals  sustainable cities and Societies , Cities Connect will focus on creating Conditions enabling secondary cities to be more efficient catalysts for sustainable urban development, poverty reduction, climate change management and resilience at local level. Their links to both major/capital cities and rural areas make secondary cities the key players in the environmental, economic and transformation process. These cities are increasingly going to play a key role in both climate adaptation and resilience-building strategies. As the population and built areas grow, energy needs will increase, while these cities are shifting to more carbon-intensive energy sources. Due to their strong links with rural areas and their dependence on primary economic activities, secondary cities will have to tackle issues such as climate-induced migration, floods, droughts, etc., as well as help capital cities mitigate environmental and socioeconomic problems. However, secondary cities face a number of binding problems that hinder their contribution to local and national development. These challenges arise from a rapid and chaotic urban expansion, which is aggravated by the lack of coordination between different levels of government, fragmented political systems and limited data and evidence for decision-making. In addition, sub-national authorities/local governmets are the first to face external negative shocks, including violent conflicts, unforeseen inflows of immigrants or refugees and more frequent natural disasters associated with climate change. Local authorities often have very limited mandates as well as poor capacities to implement policies and plans, making them heavily dependent on central government policies and financing decisions.

As of February 2021, according to UNHCR, Kenya was hosting more than 512'494 refugees and asylum seekers (49% female, 51% male) on its territory. In most cases, displace-ment is protracted and refugees remain in camps or in out-of-camp settings for years with limited freedom of movement and access to education or employment. A major reform of the national refugee legislative framework is expected to be achieved by the end of 2021, and its final outcome will be crucial for the effec-tive protection of refugees and vulnerable migrants throughout Kenya. In the framework of the project, The Refugee Consortium of Kenya (RCK) will help strengthen a human rights based and conflict sensitive refugee response in Kenya through (i) advocating for the reform of the national refugee legislation, (ii) enhancing the access to refugees' rights and (iii) strengthening peaceful coexistence between refugees and host communities.

F.a: Sustainable exit for the WID project in Yumbe and Arua districts,F.A: SUSTAINABLE EXIT FOR THE WID PROJECT IN YUMBE AND ARUA DISTRICTS,"1. Project: 12155 Sustainable Exit for the Women in Development Project in Yumbe District, Uganda 2. Project area and Country: Yumbe district, West Nile region, Uganda3. Project justification: Yumbe is one of the poorest districts in Uganda and hosts approx. 235 000 South Sudanese refugees putting additional pressure on public services delivery and access by communities to basic productive assets. Many refugee households are food insecure and dependent on reducing food aid. The district's economy is heavily relying on subsistence agriculture employing over 80% of the population. Women in general, those heading their households in particular as well as young girls, both from refugee and host communities, are most vulnerable due to their limited access to cash income, credit facilities and resources such as land, largely controlled by men. They are increasingly compelled to engage in economic activities to secure their families livelihood, however lack opportunities for income generating activities and gainful employment that would support them to become self-reliant, and are thus exposed to the risk of chronic poverty.In the previous project cycle (2018-2020), Uganda Change Agent Association assisted 1620 women to start and manage sustainable businesses and establish 54 VSLAs, the only source of financial and business development support in their villages. However, the targeted women still face challenges to grow their businesses into more professionally managed and profitable micro-enterprises, which the new project's two-year exit phase sets out to tackle.4. The main objective and expected results:The main objective is to contribute to enhanced socio-economic empowerment of poor women from refugee and host communities of Yumbe district. This will be achieved through enhanced capacity of women to manage profitable and sustainable businesses and increased access to credit for the financing of their micro-enterprises, through linking VSLAs to local finance institutions and government funding.

The United Nations estimates the number of displaced people in Yambia and Tambura counties at around 15,000 since early December. The aim of the project is to support the refugees in the Yambio county in terms of food aid (with particular attention to cases of malnutrition among children) and agricultural equipment, in order to offer families help that is sustainable over time.",Yes,0.827635586261749

Improving the resilience of informal settlements to fire (IRIS-Fire),IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE OF INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS TO FIRE (IRIS-FIRE),"This high-impact project is concerned with how an interdisciplinary approach to fire science and engineering can improve the resilience of informal settlements against fires. Through a combination of state-of-the-art experimental and modeling fire science coupled with unique data gathering in informal settlements and novel applications of existing satellite data, we will deliver a framework to assess fire risk in informal settlements and propose technologically appropriate, data driven risk reduction methodologies. Over one billion people across the globe live in informal shack settlements, and this number is ever increasing as urbanization increases. Many of these informal settlements are at constant risk of lethal and large scale fires, due to flammable construction materials, heating and cooking methods, proximity of the shacks, and a lack of effective fire services, amongst other factors. For occupants of these shacks, death and injury from fire constitute 'a serious public health problem', 96% of the world's burn-related deaths (about 300,000 deaths annually) occur in lower- and middle-income countries.   Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent at 7% average increase between 1990-2015 and the population in urban clusters has increased by 484 million people in 25 years. In South Africa it is estimated that up to one third of the population now live in informal settlements, and in Cape Town the number of informal dwellings grew from around 28,000 in 1993 to 104,000 in 2006. Cape Town is known as the fire capital of South Africa and between 1990 and 2004 the Mandisa GIS database tracked over 18,500 fire incidents recorded, 47% occurred in informal settlements. On an annual basis there are around 500 deaths and 15,000 fire related hospital related admissions due to fire in the city, of which a substantial proportion are people from informal settlements. The project will develop the new methods and tools required to evaluate and model the fire risks within South African informal settlements of the Western Cape so that situationally appropriate and cost-effective solutions and strategies can be suggested to improve the resilience of South African informal settlement communities against large-scale conflagrations. This will be achieved through producing new guidelines, based on unique experimental data generated in the UK and in South Africa, surveying of Western Cape informal settlements to improve stochastic data on their composition and topography, probabilistic modelling of informal settlements based on validated models using experimental data, and important engagement and consultation with the stakeholders within informal settlements (NGOs, fire services, policy makers and local residents) to ensure that any new guidelines are appropriate and effective.  Additionally, a framework for risk mapping and monitoring, based on results of experiments and modelling within this project, will direct and inform where interventions using the guidelines",Review,0.790482640266419

Improving early childhood development and well-being in refugee and other marginalized countries,IMPROVING EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND WELL-BEING IN REFUGEE AND OTHER MARGINALIZED COUNTRIES,"Early childhood development research has traditionally focused on single-intervention initiatives and non-refugee populations. This project will generate evidence to support effective, integrated and scalable early childhood development interventions for disadvantaged populations in low- and middle-income countries.   The project will investigate how underprivileged and marginalized environments threaten the development of children and their families. It will identify factors that build resilience in the face of these threats, especially for those who are displaced or are refugees from conflict. It will develop and validate culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive and affordable interventions that will benefit a large number of children and families. The project will then assess the effectiveness of an integrated package of interventions in critical areas of child development in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, that is home to internally and externally displaced families. It will examine the feasibility and affordability of the package of interventions and the cost of scaling up in the studied communities.   The project will also build capacity in the science of early childhood development for frontline workers, researchers and leaders in policy and practice. This includes establishing a sustainable research and policy platform to share programs and practices globally, translating evidence into policy, and enabling expansion, replication and scale-up of effective interventions on the national, regional, and global levels. It will also strengthen the North-South partnership between two key institutions, the Aga Khan University and the Sinai Health System, to establish a well-recognized centre of excellence with the organizational and intellectual capacity to advance a more global science of early human development.  The Nairobi project will be co-led by Aga Khan University's Institute of Human Development and the Sinai Health System.

Quality laboratory testing -training project in Benin,QUALITY LABORATORY TESTING -TRAINING PROJECT IN BENIN,Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious fast-growing global problem threatening effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of infectious diseases. Detection of resistant pathogenic bacteria is crucial to prevention of their spread. In Benin clinical laboratories cannot fulfill this task due to poor infrastructure and lack of skills of laboratory personnel. Furthermore physicians' understanding of  utilization of laboratory results in their treatment decisions is weak. Therefore we propose a capacity building project which aims to strengthen clinical laboratories in Benin concentrating especially in antimicrobial resistance testing and detection of resistant bacteria that cause potentially mortal blood infections including sepsis. We emphasize quality control practices that ensure as short as possible turn-around time and reliability of results. This is essential for all testing activities of clinical laboratories also in facing epidemics such as the recent Covid-19.   In our project PSR will support Beninese partners to carry out training of trainers for AMR and blood infections testing. In a training laboratory affiliated with the University of Abomey-Calavi a set of master trainers will be educated with the help of local and Finnish clinical laboratory experts. These master trainers will further train clinical laboratory technicians from all the regions of Benin invited to attend by the Beninese Ministry of Health. Altogether 60 laboratory staff will be trained and certified. Workshops bringing together physicians and laboratory experts will be arranged to design new practices facilitating efficient utilization of laboratory results in treatment of infections and reducing AMR. Evidence is collected on laboratory practices before and after the training to produce information on efficacy of provided training and to propose further paths for improving clinical laboratories and in tackling AMR.

Project activities include: (1) increasing awareness and use of services by survivors through outreach activities, (2) building the self-reliance skills of 4,000 women with information on their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), functional numeracy and literacy skills, nutrition and core life skills, (3) engaging 30,000 community members through implementing, for the first time in Bangladesh, the SASA!

Cox's Bazar is one of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable districts, with poverty well above the country's national average. The influx of Rohingya has increased economic tensions and competition for scarce resources, including jobs and income among the Rohingya and the existing Bangleshi communities where the refugees are camped, as well as having a serious impact on local infrastructure and services. This situation is particularly difficult for women and children who are the most vulnerable.The project works to improve the accessibility to GBV and psychosocial services in public health facilities and women-friendly spaces for survivors of GBV. Project activities include: (1) increasing awareness and use of services by survivors through outreach activities, (2) building the self-reliance skills of 4,000 women with information on their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), functional numeracy and literacy skills, nutrition and core life skills, (3) engaging 30,000 community members through implementing, for the first time in Bangladesh, the SASA! (Start, Awareness, Support, Action) community mobilization strategy for raising awareness and preventing GBV, and (4) developing a community-based GBV response and prevention program, including engagement with men and boys for their role in protecting families and communities from GBV.Benefiting over 500,000 women and girls, the project supports the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in: (1) strengthening public health facilities to provide high-quality midwifery and emergency obstetric care, (2) increasing the availability of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, including family planning, contraception and treatment of STIs and HIV, and (3) developing training materials and providing training for health care providers on GBV response and treatment of survivors. / Le projet vise Ã  fournir des soins de santÃ© sexuelle et reproductive Ã©quitables et Ã  lutter contre la violence basÃ©e sur le genre (VBG) pour les personnes vivant dans les communautÃ©s locales de Cox's Bazar touchÃ©es par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 rÃ©fugiÃ©s rohingyas depuis aoÃ»t 2017.

Establishing a harmonized reproductive health registry in Jordan to improve maternal and child health,ESTABLISHING A HARMONIZED REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH REGISTRY IN JORDAN TO IMPROVE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH,"The lack of reliable data limits the ability of health providers, planners, and community members to make informed decisions that can influence the well-being of women and children, particularly in vulnerable and undercounted populations. This project supports the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry (hRHR). This network is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and then back to communities in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan.   Given the high number of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address the different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. More specifically, the project will analyze existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use, develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization, strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men, and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes, develop a dashboard of data and related analysis, assess the quality, timeliness, and reliability of data, and build the capacities of researchers and decision-makers.   The main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and inter-operability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.    This project represents one of nine spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems). The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada's new Feminist International Assistance Policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development.

Climate and nutrition smart villages as platforms to address food insecurity in Myanmar,CLIMATE AND NUTRITION SMART VILLAGES AS PLATFORMS TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY IN MYANMAR,"Myanmar is at risk from a wide range of natural hazards, including cyclones, floods, and droughts. These risks are especially challenging for poor rural women and children, who suffer even more from hunger, food insecurity, and a lack of adequate health services. Since these risks differ across agro-ecosystems in the country, it is crucial that adaptation measures recognize the value of targeted, location-specific, community-based strategies and processes.   Community-based adaptation approaches have been tested in the Philippines for the past three years and are currently being mainstreamed via national government processes. This project builds on lessons from these methodological, institutional, and model-building research efforts leveraging the linkages between agriculture, climate change, and nutrition.   The goal of this project is to identify and scale optimal climate-smart agriculture practices and interventions suitable for the four major agro-ecological regions of Myanmar: the central dry zone, the mountain uplands, the upland-plateau, and the delta.   Using participatory research methods, the study, implemented by the New York City-based International Institute for Rural Reconstruction, will assess a portfolio of low-cost technologies and interventions in selected locations that serve as Climate Smart Villages. Towards the end of the project, scalable models will lead to guidelines for promoting a number of proven approaches that farmers can select for their specific agro-ecological zones.",Yes,0.6687371134758

F.a: Kishapu Climate Change Adaptation Programme,F.A: KISHAPU CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PROGRAMME,"The Kishapu area is one of the poorest of Tanzania. A challenge is the shortage of potable water. The situation has deteriorated as the local climate becomes drier. Reasons are increased firewood usage due to population increase, and traditional farming methods. This has transformed the area into semi-desert in many places. Chemicals harmful to health have polluted ground water. A new challenge is rainfall unpredictability brought about by climate change, which weakens food security. The project, part of the TCRS village community empowerment program, supports the population in the area in adapting to the change in their habitat and in prevention of desertification. Expected long-term effects: members of village communities within project sphere of influence actively participate in the development of their villages taking into consideration environmental impacts. Results of activities (i) improved status of women and girls, youth, hiv-positive and disbled individuals, (ii) improved availability of clean drinking water, (iii) functioning hygiene and sanitary solutions in schools and homes, (iv)  members of village communities in project villages participate in decision making and development of their communities with regard to environmental impacts, (v) behaviour of households is modified to be more environmentally friendly, (vi) transparent, responsible, and democratic leadership in project villages. The Kishapu project area covers 14 villages, and the education project includes 8Â 313 beneficiaries (3039W, 1671M, 2091G, 1512B, including 213 disabled individuals) and 504 (139W, 365M) bearers of responsibility. Additionaly there are 31Â 613 indirect beneficiaries. The target groups are children and youth in danger of becoming marginalized, disabled people, women, girls, victims of financial, sexual, and physical abuse, civil servants, political decision makers, and key individuals of organizations. The project is implemented by Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS). Their area of expertise includes the problems of refugees and those living in extreme poverty and human rights based approach in village communities.

The women will first be engaged in public-works to rehabilitate and/or climate proof critical local infrastructure for which they receive a small, predictable, fortnightly, salary during a period of six months. A part of the remuneration is set aside in compulsory savings which the women will access as a lump-sum at the end of the public-works period to allow them to, for example start their own small-scale businesses. They will also be trained in various life-skills as well as skills relevant for future employments, enhancing their networks and contributing to personal dignity. Assistance will also be provided to access digital financial services and insurance schemes.

Under a new core policy action, SSC completed a comprehensive analysis of a strategic development and sector road map for 2010 to 2020 to address market infrastructure bottlenecks for capital market growth. To address accounting standards, the government initiated a gap assessment to more closely align Vietnamese accounting standards with the IAS and developed an implementation timeline. To enhance market information standards, the draft Law on Independent Audit was submitted to the government. To enhance information disclosure, the Vietnam Securities Depository (VSD) completed the pilot implementation of the automatic synchronization of records between its head office and branches for public companies registered with VSD. To strengthen VSD s risk management capacity, a risk assessment of its central depository and clearing functions benchmarked against international practices will be undertaken.Output 2: Strengthened institutional framework for securities issuance. To develop the government securities market, the program supports institutional reforms such as the establishment of Public Debt Management Office (PDMO).

Duboko extension: Regional solid waste management project in Serbia - Duboko extension: Regional solid waste management,DUBOKO EXTENSION: REGIONAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT PROJECT IN SERBIA - DUBOKO EXTENSION: REGIONAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT,"The Public Utility Company of Duboko, owned by 9 municipalities in the region,  started the construction of a regional landfill in 2008, financially supported by EBRD, EU the Serbian government and Sida. The project has been completed and the landfill is in operation since 2011. Due to the poor location of the landfill site, and risk for landslides, PUC Duboko urgently needs to stabilize and extend the landfill in order to continue its operations. A new major landslide is likely to put an end to PUC Duboko operations for some time to come. It would probably also cause serious pollution of the Turkish creek, which runs close to the landfill area.The proposed new Duboko sustainability project aims to provide additional disposal capacity of minimum 2.5 years, increase the stability of the landfill to minimize the risk for new landslides and, through technical assistance, improve the operational performance of PUC Duboko and support the Ministry's development of a realistic municipal solid waste investment pipeline.The stabilization and extension of the landfill site would consist of disposal directly below and to the south of the current site. This would not only provide more space for landfilling but also stabilize the whole site, allowing for disposal on the higher etages 4 and 5, which is not possible today (due to the risk of land slide). In total it would allow a minimum of 2.5 years of additional disposal capacity and there is space on the south side to continue disposal for approximately 25 years (that will be done at a later stage, I e not supported by this project).Through the Swedish supported Environmental Infrastructure Support Program (EISP), support has already started to strengthen the operational, managerial and financial aspects of PUC Duboko s services and have also supported the initial technical preparations for the new construction. The support from EISP will contine, with already decided funding, and will provide complimentary work to the actual construction work which will be managed by EBRD.

GCRF Clean Environment and Planetary Health in Asia (CEPHA) Network,GCRF CLEAN ENVIRONMENT AND PLANETARY HEALTH IN ASIA (CEPHA) NETWORK,"Pollution of the air, water and soil is the largest environmental cause of non-communicable disease and death worldwide, responsible for around 9 million premature deaths annually. The greatest increases in non-communicable diseases are seen in low- and middle-income countries now experiencing epidemics of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Outdoor and indoor air pollution combined account for around 7 million of these deaths, predominantly in developing countries of Asia, particularly India and China. Environmental pollution affects everyone in society creating a heavy burden on quality of life, productivity and school performance. The underprivileged, including female and children, living and working in polluted environments are more at risk and unable to avoid exposure. Greenhouse gases emitted from the same sources (e.g. motorised transport, waste burning) have an impact on climate, increasing the risk of extreme weather events such as floods and heatwaves. Asian countries are urbanising rapidly and unsustainably, locking their populations in polluting behaviours through inefficient land use planning and poorly designed transport and housing infrastructure. Environmental pollution is a drain on development, disproportionately affecting underprivileged communities, for example those living in informal settlements, and vulnerable individuals, for example those with respiratory illness. For too long the relationship between prosperity and environment has been seen as a trade-off.  Tackling pollution was considered a handicap to economic growth. Growing evidence now shows sustainable development can help improve not only health and the environment, but also the economy.  The drive towards cleaner environments and low carbon development, provides a compelling opportunity to realise multiple societal benefits: to improve health and the environment, innovate and become more competitive. To address the huge development challenge of environmental pollution and non-communicable diseases in Asia, and harness opportunities provided by sustainable development, we propose the engagement network on Clean Environment and Planetary Health in Asia (CEPHA): to catalyse technological and societal innovation through deep engagement across disciplines and sectors that will stimulate transformative changes to business models, government policies and public health practice in Asia. Network outcomes will include long-lasting partnerships, enhanced knowledge exchange and capacity building, and co-creation of projects and resources focusing on actionable solutions to the challenges of improving the environment, decarbonising the economy, and reducing the burden on non-communicable diseases in Asia. We will identify and promote best practice that has the greatest potential to reduce pollution from different sources (transport, household energy, waste) and related non-communicable diseases, particularly in vulnerable groups (children, female, informal",Yes,0.519631803035736

GCRF Mine Dust and Health Network,GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK,"GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK SUMMARY While the mining industry contributes significantly to the economies of developing countries around the world, mining activities have notable negative environmental and health impacts. Among these, the dust emitted by mining and its associated operations is a cause of increasing concern. Apart from impacting the health of mine-workers who breathe in mineral dust particles, dust is emitted from open pit mines, ore processing and metal extraction plants, ore stockpiles, ore transport containers and mine waste deposits, impacting the wider environment and communities. Lung diseases caused or exacerbated by mine dust exposure include silicosis (caused by inhaling quartz or crystalline silica), black lung disease (caused by inhaling coal dust) and tuberculosis (silica dust exposure increases the risk of pulmonary TB, particularly in gold miners). This places a huge burden on already-strained public health and social security systems. Occupational health hazards from mining are well documented, and the link between dust and lung disease was recently recognised in a class action lawsuit against the six main mining houses in South Africa, awarded in favour of mine workers who contracted silicosis and TB working on gold mines between March 1965 and May 2018 (https://www.silicosissettlement.co.za/). However, the health effects associated with environmental dust emissions, although frequently a concern expressed by communities and community support organisations, have not been rigorously studied. Meaningful data is needed to inform what strategies and policies will work best to mitigate the effects of mine dust on communities living near mines and mine dumps, the populations of which number in their millions. Gathering such data is not simple, however. There are many complexities involved, with dust sources and their effects being influenced by inter-related factors covering the health, economic, social, geological, environmental, engineering, management, and political spheres. The issues associated with mine dust are also frequently contentious and involve diverse stakeholders and interested and affected parties with different, and often conflicting priorities. Poor engagement and communication between experts and lay persons, disciplinary silos and polarised viewpoints have made it difficult to develop a holistic understanding of the complex health issues associated with environmental emissions of mine dusts, and consequently to design meaningful and integrated approaches to address such issues. It is these challenges that our GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK will seek to address by bringing together researchers, stakeholders and practitioners from a variety of disciplines and professional backgrounds to identify sources, challenges and potential mitigation opportunities associated with public health effects from dust pollution arising from mining activities. Focus will be on integrating and sharing knowledge and",Review,0.473156452178955

The program strives for a balance between preserving ecosystems and to support local people in to use these for their livelihood in a sustainable manner. Two independent reviews of the MFF has concluded that the program is run effectively and achieve its goals.MFFs activities in the member states is governed by a   National Strategic Action Plan  , NSAP , which is developed and owned by the countries themselves. NSAP controls the direction of the small-scale project that is the core of MFFs business. Through systematic monitoring , learning and evaluation of these projects results are collected, disseminated through reports , MFFs website etc. channels. Some results have been used by countries in the development of policies and regulations . The information is also shared between the member countries. The regional work within the MFF has been strengthened during the ongoing phase 2 , including through a special project facility for regional projects. During the planned Phase 3 regional efforts will be expanded as well as knowledge creation and dissemination. Another significant initiative is a more systematic approach to and collaboration with private sector. During Phase 3 , the intention is that countries  own contribution should be increased , especially for projects in their own country.MFF operates in ten countries from Pakistan in the west to Indonesia in the East.

Exploring the private-sector role in the Sustainable Development Goal data revolution,EXPLORING THE PRIVATE-SECTOR ROLE IN THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL DATA REVOLUTION,"In Sri Lanka and Colombia, call detail records (CDRs) have been used to predict population-level socioeconomic characteristics and displacement after natural disasters. In sub-Saharan Africa and India, Facebook and other social media data have been used to map the population and provide alternative data to predict credit scores to expand financial inclusion. Since the announcement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the calls for a data revolution for sustainable development, the private sector has been asked to commit to partnering with the public sector in achieving the SDGs. Calls for private sector actions such as data sharing and capacity building to assist in monitoring and achieving SDGs were met by public commitments by the private sector.

Addressing climate- and water-driven migration and conflict interlinkages to build Community Resilience in the Congo Basin,ADDRESSING CLIMATE- AND WATER-DRIVEN MIGRATION AND CONFLICT INTERLINKAGES TO BUILD COMMUNITY RESILIENCE IN THE CONGO BASIN,"The Congo Basin holds approximately 40% of African water discharge and is critical to continental and local water security. Adverse effects of climate change, including changes in seasonal rainfall and increased frequency and intensity of floods, landslides, and soil erosion are amplifying the vulnerabilities of the Basin's 120 million people, who are reliant on rain-fed agriculture. This is especially true for women, who account for more than 73% of the people who derive their livelihoods from agriculture and who produce more than 80% of the region's food crops.   There is also speculation that climate change leads to or exacerbates conflicts within the Congo Basin due to increased pressure on resources. The usual human mobility trends have recently been replaced by new patterns of pastoralist migration from northern regions to access the basin's arable land, pasture, and water resources, resulting in new kinds of conflicts.  These interlinked challenges threaten livelihoods, increase competition, intensify divisions and ethnic tension, reduce state capability and legitimacy, and trigger poorly designed climate action. Empirical research to obtain up-to-date hydro-climatic and socioeconomic information is needed to address climate and water-driven migration, conflict interlinkages, and their implications for the basin's population.    This project will involve quantitative and qualitative research and training activities for key stakeholders in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The field research will target communities of pastoralists, farmers, fishers, Indigenous peoples and migrants. The project activities will guide the identification and assessment of gender-specific climate adaptation and conflict resolution strategies such as water preservation, water use sharing, access to potable water, income generation, food security, and livelihoods. This is expected to directly benefit an estimated 600 people, of which approximately 60% are women.   The project is expected to contribute to the implementation of the DRC's National Strategic Plan for Development that was adopted in 2017 and calls for protection of the environment, access to water and sanitation, and adaptation to climate change for a better quality of life.",Review,0.383118212223053

Voice & Visibility for Southern African LGBTI Activists Through Copenhagen 2021 World Pride Activities,VOICE & VISIBILITY FOR SOUTHERN AFRICAN LGBTI ACTIVISTS THROUGH COPENHAGEN 2021 WORLD PRIDE ACTIVITIES,"Stronger activist voices for social equality and economic inclusion of LGBTI people in southern African societies.Almost half the countries in southern Africa have either decriminalized homosexual sex or are reviewing laws that discriminate against LGBTI citizens, either by voluntary legal reform or court challenge. The region is near a tipping point of irreversible change in recognising the human rights of LGBTI people. Sustained systemic progress towards equality and freedom for LGBTI citizens in the region now at once requires more joined up, strategic, and hard-hitting public advocacy capability by LGBTI human rights activists (especially intersex, lesbian, and transgender groups who are the least organised, visible, and resourced), as well as more robust direct engagement of duty bearers in the public, private, and social spheres in southern Africa for deep change in public policies and attitudes. Stronger multi-country networks amongst LGBTI human rights activists and with allies (e.g. in the mass media, religious organizations, business, government, cultural traditional leadership, and amongst parents and families of LGBTI activists), will both advance such an advocacy agenda and increase preventive security â because broad-based networks form a good protection and support system. But as the voice and visibility and corresponding heightened vulnerability of activists on the frontline grows, new responsive protection mechanisms are also needed for the crises that will come with an expected backlash.Copenhagen 2021 World Pride presents a unique catalytic opportunity for LGBTI activists from southern Africa to re-group, to come together in a more focused way to share learning and develop COVID-19 appropriate advocacy strategies and plan for how to implement them. This will in particularly apply to litigation and other forms of advocacy for social equality that were already initiated in several countries in the region before the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTI activism in the region, and in regard to advocacy for economic inclusion, empowerment, and participation.Such engagement will contribute to advancing several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at once in southern Africa and globally in the framework of 'leave no-one behind', especially the SDGs to overcome poverty (SDG1) linked to economic growth, employment, and decent work (SDG8) and safe, inclusive, and resilient communities (SDG11), achieve gender equality (SDG5), ensure social and political inclusion to reduce inequality within and among countries (SDG10), ensure access to justice, non-discriminatory laws, and inclusive institutions (SDG16).",Review,0.244638070464134

The impact and outcome will be achieved through the following five project outputs: (i) wetland protection at the YRBNNR, (ii) wetland protection at the DMNNR, (iii) coastal forest improvement at the Sheyang forest farm, (iv) coastal forest improvement at the Dafeng forest farm, and (v) project management and capacity development.The project activities will include (i) wetland habitat rehabilitation and restoration, including rehydration of dehydrated critical habitats for water birds, conversion of fish ponds into wildlife habitats, and improvement of the milu drinking water and food supplies, (ii) control of the Spartina alterniflora as an invasive species along the Jiangsu coast by the use of freshwater flooding, (iii) improvement and protection of coastal forests, including improvement of the irrigation and drainage systems, fire prevention, pest early warning system and integrated pest management, and reforestation, (iv) waste management, including collection and safe disposal of solid wastes in the nature reserves, (v) pilot and demonstration of ecological compensation and sustainable use of ecological services, including the promotion of sustainable financing mechanism through provincial and municipal program, and market-based instruments, the implementation of ecological compensation program in a pilot community, agroforestry, such as forest-crop intercropping, and eco-tourism, and (vi) capacity development for wetland ecosystem protection, including research, ecological monitoring, meteorological and hydrological observation, animal rescue, technical assistance on nature reserve management planning, and training on procurement and contract management, project management, and financial management. The proposed activities will have the benefit of mitigating climate change through carbon sequestration, and the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will quantify this benefit.",Review,0.212139576673508

The strategy is spearheaded by such urban development schemes as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and its subcomponent the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. Apart from supporting the Government's priority of planned development of urban centers in the country, the Investment Program is also aligned with the objectives of fostering economic growth and reducing poverty in Rajasthan. The fast growing sectors in Rajasthan are mostly in urban areas, where productivity is 3.5 times higher than in rural areas. The emphasis on urban development in Rajasthan, financial reforms and the passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act in 1992, which laid the basis for decentralization in the urban sector, have made some improvements, but large inefficiencies in service delivery, low investment in wider service coverage, and poor maintenance persist.The Investment Program and its road map are guided by the 10th FYP 2002-2007 and 11th FYP 2007-2012 of the Government of India.

This will involve a sewing course and teaching on the principles of the circular economy. The design products will be sold in Iceland and all economic income will be transferred to SADA's continued operations and job creation for women refugees in Turkey.

While the extension takes the form of a no-cost extension to allow existing donors not yet ready to commit new funds to remain engaged, the intention is also to enable CIWA to raise funds to reach its initially set target of USD 200 million. The Fund's current total value is  USD 93 million, 35 308 689 of which (or 284 million SEK) have been contributed by Sweden since 2012. Sweden has support the fund since its inception in 2012 and one decsion on contribution and two decisions to add funds have been taken.  Other donors include the Netherlands, the UK, The EU, Denmark and Norway. To date, almost all funds paid into CIWA have been allocated to pipeline, hence planning of new activities will depend on new resources coming in to the fund. The Netherlands recently announced that it will be appraising an additional contribution of USD 20 million in the latter half of 2018 and the WB is also fund-raising with new donors.The current agreement amendment will increase Sida's support to CIWA with another 100 MSEK to a total of 384 MSEK and extend the support to 2026. The funding is channeled through a World Bank Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), of which 75% is recipient executed and 25% is executed by the World Bank, but according to the Trust Fund Assurance Framework 3013 all funds must be programmed according to World Bank guidelines.CIWA was established for a 10-year period (2011-21). An independent mid-term review of the program in 2015 found that CIWA's objectives remained highly relevant, its basic operational approach was sound, and made several specific recommendations to strengthen the program, which are now largely implemented. Sweden has supported CIWA since 2012, and has over the years seen the program deliver good results. The program seems to be on target or over performing against most of its intermediate level indicators. It has a good fit with the Swedish Strategy for SSA, and Sida is therefore interested in CIWA's possibility to continue and expand operation. CIWA's objective is to strengthen cooperative water resources management and development to enable sustainable, climate resilient economic growth in Africa. CIWA helps countries take advantage of opportunities as it advances investments in basin-wide information systems, in institutions for cooperation and coordination or in infrastructure with transboundary impact that can store surplus waters, protect against floods, generate hydropower, promote food security, and enhance resilience in the face of climate change. CIWA also assist riparian States to manage risk as it promotes countries' awareness of their interdependencies and helps them strike a better balance in their decision-making between sovereign and collective considerations. This is becoming increasingly important as communities across Africa increasingly compete for scarce fresh water r",Review,0.178117424249649

Ethiopia, with Uganda, is hosting the largest number of registered refugee population in Africa. The project will target both South Sudanese refugees and host communities living in the areas surrounding the camps. South Sudanese refugees have been placed in Gambella Region, located in the South West of the country and bordering South Sudan, against a local population totalling some 310,000 people, of whom approximately 45% are Nuer and 22% Anuak, Gambella hosts more than 350,000 South Sudanese refugees, most of them Nuer, placed in 7 camps. Literacy level is exceptionally low among the South Sudanese, the average literacy rate being 27% (female literacy rate is 16%, and male 40%). This is reflected in UNHCR data from the camps in Gambella, according to which more than 70% of the whole South Sudanese refugee population is uneducated. Similarly, illiteracy is very high also among the local population in Gambela, reaching 54% in the population of 15 ? 60 year olds (40% among males and 66% females). Since the majority of the population in Gambella is Nuer as South Sudanese refugees, FRC intervention on functional literacy will target equally refugees and host communities. The objective of the project is that through an inclusive approach, refugees and host communities in Ethiopia have enhanced their capacity to anticipate, manage, and recover from shocks (resilience) and their mutual relationship (social cohesion) has improved. The outcome of the project is that adult South Sudanese refugees in camps and host communities living nearby are empowered by the acquisition of functional literacy and life skills.

The analysis will consider potential differential effects of carbon pricing across socio-economic groups, and between high, medium and low-income countries, as a basis for considering policy interventions to mitigate inequitable outcomes.This analysis will contribute to the goal of The Lancet-Chatham House Commission which is to identify actions that can impact positively across the shared drivers of the three threats to human and planetary health described above.

Agrarian Reform Communities Project II,AGRARIAN REFORM COMMUNITIES PROJECT II,"The Project will support the Government's Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2005-1010. It will pursue a holistic approach to poverty reduction by promoting an agribusiness approach to rural development. It will assist the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) by addressing the most pressing requirements for support in 152 agrarian reform communities (ARCs) and ARC Clusters in 19 provinces in southern Philippines. The long-term impact of the Project is to enable ARB households and other sections of the rural poor in approximately 152 selected ARCs and ARC Clusters (ARC Clusters will include target ARCs and ARBs and other farmers in adjacent areas) in 19 provinces (the provinces to be covered include Romblon, Marinduque, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Negros Oriental, Leyte, Eastern Samar, Northern Samar, Western Samar, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Shariff Kabunsuan, Maguindanao, Lanao Del Sur, Tawi Tawi, Basilan, and Sulu) to reduce their poverty, and have sustained improvements in their incomes and quality of life. In order to achieve these impacts, the Project is expected to bring about long lasting improvements in the capabilities and well being of poor and marginalized groups in the target communities. In order to achieve the above outcomes of poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, the Project will support the following outputs: (i) strong participation of local communities in the development process by the (a) enhancement of social capital among target communities through the use of a CDD approach, (b) detailed participatory ARC planning based on participation by the rural poor, as well as (c) improved capacity of ARC organizations and LGUs, for better governance and convergence in the provision of support services to target communities, (ii) agri enterprise development (AED)including (a) transfer of technology, (b) greater entrepreneurship among ARC organizations, (c) linkages between the private sector and corporate entities and ARC organizations, for increased investments into rural areas for growth, (d) wider prevalence of community based savings and lending groups for setting up sustainable micro-finance services among communities, (e) Land Tenure Improvement to improve security of land titles, enable investments into productivity enhancements, (iii) improved access to rural infrastructure, designed to provide a boost to improved production and productivity, and crop intensification, and (iv) improved project management.",Yes,0.157518729567528
Urgent Appeals: Data and Shared Learning,URGENT APPEALS: DATA AND SHARED LEARNING,"Context: The working conditions for today's typical garment worker are poor. The majority of production is located in the global south, mainly in parts of Asia, and ODA countries feature prominently as locations for production.  With low associational power and limited access to remedy, workers need international allies in order to get their voices heard. The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) has campaigned for the accountability of brands and lobbied policy makers for some 30 years. One of its core mechanisms for interacting with human rights defenders (HRDs) and other civil society actors is its Urgent Appeal (UA) system.  Through the UA system workers and their organisations can contact CCC for support. Examples of UAs taken up by CCC include large scale disasters such as the Tazreen fire in Bangladesh in 2012, which killed over 100 workers, the Ali Enterprises Fire in Pakistan in 2012 where 265 people died, and the Rana Plaza building collapse in 2013 which killed over 1,000 workers and injured 2,000 more. In addition to health and safety, UAs may also relate to workers' rights such as freedom of association, wage theft or in relation to intimidation and harassment of HRDs. Each UA case file is a repository of information which, if organised, coded, analysed and fully utilised, could provide support for advocacy and campaigning at both international and local level.  In 2018 researchers at Cardiff University were awarded funding under the IAA NGO data fund, with the aim of constructing a user-friendly dataset of UA data that could be used by CCC in strategising campaigns, identifying tactics that have worked in specific contexts and providing a strong evidential base for targeted lobbying and advocacy. The project concluded in March 2019 with its limited objectives met, but having highlighted the need for further work to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data across cases and undertake more detailed analysis of relationships between variables in UA case histories.   Aims and objectives: The overarching aim of the proposed project is to maximise the use of UA data that CCC holds but has not hitherto fully utilised. Such data has significant potential as an evidential base for decision making, strategic planning and targeting of tactics in campaigning and advocacy. Two key objectives sit at the centre of the current application:   Research Objective 1: To further review and evaluate the UA IAA database in collaboration with CCC colleagues, with three aims:  a) to address issues highlighted to CCC in March 2019 around incomplete or inaccurate data, thereby improving its comprehensiveness and accuracy,  b) to undertake a comprehensive needs analysis and assess the functional capacity of the UA database for future usage in the light of sectoral trends,  c) to make recommendations for the maintenance and utilisation of the dataset within CCC.

Economic autonomy and employability for women affected by Covid-19 and hurricanes Eta and Iota,ECONOMIC AUTONOMY AND EMPLOYABILITY FOR WOMEN AFFECTED BY COVID-19 AND HURRICANES ETA AND IOTA,"TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: AutonomÃ­a EconÃ³mica y empleabilidad para mujeres afectadas por el Covid-19 y huracanes Eta e Iota :: El proyecto pretende trabajar por la autonomÃ­a econÃ³mica y empleabilidad de 50 mujeres de San Pedro Sula y Choloma, en situaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidad agravada por el COVID19 y/o los huracanes Eta e Iota de noviembre 2020 (emergencia apoyada por Ayto.Bilbao). Todo ello desde un enfoque de gÃ©nero, derechos de las mujeres y ciudadanÃ­a crÃ­tica. Esta propuesta parte de dos realidades: por una parte, del acompaÃ±amiento permanente que Caritas de San Pedro Sula realiza en comunidades de alta vulnerabilidad en el departamento de CortÃ©s, especialmente con mujeres. Y, por otra, del contexto que ha marcado de una forma muy acusada la realidad de estas comunidades en los Ãºltimos meses, tanto con los efectos de la pandemia COVID19 como del paso de los huracanes Eta e Iota en noviembre de 2020.  En este sentido, se plantea una propuesta que vaya a dar respuesta a todas estas cuestiones de la siguiente forma:  - Proceso para la mejora de la empleabilidad de 20 mujeres jÃ³venes de San Pedro Sula y Choloma: estas 20 mujeres participarÃ¡n en un proceso de orientaciÃ³n laboral y mejora de sus capacidades de bÃºsqueda de empleo y se les darÃ¡ la posibilidad de formarse vocacionalmente para mejorar sus posibilidades de encontrar un empleo. Se les harÃ¡ un seguimiento, se intermediarÃ¡ con posibles empleadores... todo con la finalidad de conseguir la inserciÃ³n laboral de estas jÃ³venes que han abandonado el sistema escolar.  - Apoyo a 30 mujeres jefas de hogar que han perdido sus negocios (y no solo esto, sino tambiÃ©n han sufrido pÃ©rdidas en viviendas, bienes...), fundamentalmente por fenÃ³menos climÃ¡ticos adversos (tormentas tropicaes Eta e Iota), quedando en una situaciÃ³n de pobreza y vulnerabilidad. Se les apoyarÃ¡ para la reactivaciÃ³n de estos negocios, tanto con la mejora de capacidades para la gestiÃ³n y desempeÃ±o de los mismos, asÃ­ como con la dotaciÃ³n de insumos y equipos y la formaciÃ³n de estructuras organizativas conjuntas para mejorar la gestiÃ³n de los emprendimientos.  - Proceso de formaciÃ³n a estas 50 mujeres en cuanto a sus liderazgos personales y colectivos y sus derechos de todo tipo (DESCA, de gÃ©nero). Proceso encaminado a la creaciÃ³n de una conciencia de ciudadanÃ­a crÃ­tica y de participaciÃ³n y organizaciÃ³n para la exigencia del cumplimiento de sus derechos. Se espera que con este planteamiento se conseguirÃ¡ no solo que 50 mujeres en situaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidad mejoren su autonomÃ­a econÃ³mica, sino que de este proceso salgan concienciadas tanto de los derechos que tienen como mujeres, asÃ­ como de la necesidad de organizarse y juntarse con otras mujeres para el logro de sus objetivos, tanto a nivel econÃ³mico (en el caso de las emprendedoras), sino a nivel de sus derechos. El proceso colectivo debe llevar a una sororidad entre mujeres que favorezca enfrentar los problemas que tienen desde la sororidad.",Review,0.136318102478981

GCRF Urban Violence & Climate Change Network,GCRF URBAN VIOLENCE & CLIMATE CHANGE NETWORK,"Violence and climate change risks in the global South are increasingly urbanised, convergent and growing development challenges, negatively affecting the livelihoods, mobility and well-being of the most marginalised urban communities. Both urban violence and climate change impacts in cities also have economic costs, which affect overall development outcomes. Non-conflict violence in particular - spanning several forms of violence including gang violence, sectarian conflict, landlord-tenant conflicts and gender-based / intersectional violence - accounts for the largest share of the global burden of armed violence and is in large part urban. However, its implications have not been fully understood in the context of the climate change impacts and responses affecting urban areas. Urbanisation in developing countries is driving up climate-related risks and vulnerabilities across a spectrum of hazards, while climate adaptation and mitigation responses are now taking place in ways that alter urban socio-ecological systems. Without explicit consideration of violence-related risks, climate change programmes may exacerbate urban violence, or simply not reach vulnerable areas. Conversely, greater synergy of response in urban planning practices to address public security and climate change vulnerability - through the design of public spaces or public health interventions - can support human development gains. All the countries included in the network face the development challenge of ensuring safe, sustainable and inclusive urban development occurs now and into the future, and without which they will not be able to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals.   Researchers and practitioners working on urban climate change and those working on urban violence have had little opportunity to connect agendas. As a result, we lack understanding of how the two phenomena relate in peoples' livelihoods and influence respective initiatives for risk reduction. The aim of the network is to address this gap through research and practice change, in order to reduce the vulnerabilities of marginalised urban groups. Working across cities in Brazil, Honduras, Kenya, Jordan, Sudan, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka, the network will support inter-disciplinary workshops with researchers, local and international civil society organisations, municipal governments and networks and international agencies. These will define a future research agenda. The network will also support related practitioner learning through stronger exchange about initiatives to address climate risks and peace building in urban contexts. This will involve webinars, the development of website resources and a practitioner exchange forum. Finally, the network will support participation of network members in major global policy debates about urban security, climate change and development, to raise the policy profile of the importance of considering urban violence-climate linkages, and the practical and ethical imp",Review,0.111843548715115

The Programme has three thematical result areas namely: child protection youth employment and empowerment and resilience building in terms of strengthening economic social and climate resilience of families and communities. Furthermore the Programme has strong focus on strengthening civil society and promoting the rights of people with disabilities and women. In addition World Vision will apply the triple nexus approach when working within refugees and host communities.The Programme will be implemented in eleven projects out of which two are implemented as long-term Area Programmes. To solve the challenges in developing countries new innovations and partners are needed and therefore there will be extended cooperation with the private sector and other CSOs.Changes in the global situation are reflected in the selection of the implementation countries. The Programme will be implemented in 6 countries in East-Africa i.e. Burundi Ethiopia Kenya Rwanda Somalia and Uganda. All of these countries belong to the least developed countries excluding Kenya. Further all countries or project areas can be considered fragile.In the target country the partner is always the National World Vision Office that has extensive experience strong field presence wide networks and good contacts with the local government. Being part of the large WVI Partnership WVF benefits from professional assistance and advice in making strategic choices and in implementing innovative special projects.The planning work has involved a human rights assessment in collaboration with the partners and the Programme is building on the experience gained in previous programmes and learnings from recent evaluations. The projects and working areas in the Programme have been selected through consideration of the Human Rights Framework Finland?s development policy priorities focus areas for WVF and the National Offices and the most pressing challenges in child protection youth employment livelihoods and resilience in the partner countries and communities where we plan to work.,Review,0.110438652336597

F.a: FBAK-Project,F.A: FBAK-PROJECT,"The project's aim is to increase access and utilization of maternal and new-born services, and decreased maternal and infant mortality through the widening use of the Finnish Baby Aid Kit (FBAK). The project aims to gain support from the county givernment for the use and distribution of the FBAK. Currently, in Kenya, only 62 % of children are born assisted by professionals, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) MDG 2014 Report has listed Kenya amongst the 25 countries with insufficient progress in curbing the under-five mortality rate. The Maternity Package is a Finnish innovation which is and has been a vital part of the maternal and child health concept and program that has led Finland among the top countries in the world in terms of maternal and child health related issues. The distribution of the Baby Aid Kit in Kenya is conditional in the sense that mothers receiving it are required to make regular pre-natal visits to health facilities and to give birth attended by skilled heath personnel. The project is continuation of Weconomy project in 2017 (funded by Finnpartnership) with an aim at piloting the Maternity Package/Baby Aid Kit at the Kakuma Refugee Camp. The end of project evaluation indicated an increase in the ANC visits at all four health facilities and two health facilities out of four reported an increase from 30 to 60 % in skilled deliveries during project implementation. However the country government?s support for the distribution of the kit is required to strengthen the sustainability of the project results. The project will focus on capacitating the local communities to lobby for stronger financial support from the county government for the distribution of the baby aid kit using World Vision?s CVA model as the main method.

With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 24,000 children (12,240 girls and 11,760 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 80 school facilities (60 formal public schools and 20 daraas or Koranic schools), as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education).

The project is a regional response to the educational needs of girls, adolescent girls and women. The project identified twenty-four primary and secondary schools in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to benefit from its activities, with a total of 34,827 students between the ages of 5 and 18 (50% of whom are girls and 80% of whom are refugees/displaced persons). The project anticipates helping 22,172 girls enrolled in these schools (between the ages of 5 and 18, and of whom 73% are refugees or displaced persons) to experience an improvement in their education. 1,280 out-of-school girls and women will benefit from informal vocational training and support to develop income-generating activities and 6,300 women to strengthen their commitment to girls' education. This totals 22,314 empowered girls, adolescent girls  and women as direct beneficiaries of the project. Project activities include: (1) conducting a participatory, holistic and gender-sensitive study on the individual status of girls and adolescent girls, including refugees, displaced persons, returnees and persons living with disabilities (RDRD), and  the obstacles and specific demands related to their education, (2) developing, with the education staff, teaching and learning materials that are inclusive, gender-sensitive and adapted to the realities of the most vulnerable girls and adolescents, including RDRD, and (3) strengthening coordination mechanisms among local, national and regional actors involved in women's education to increase their participation and the consideration of their voices.The project is implemented by the Fondation Paul GÃ©rin-Lajoie and the Centre for International Studies and Cooperation in partnership with local partners, including Caritas in the DRC, Maison Shalom in Rwanda, the Concertation des collectifs des associations fÃ©minines de la rÃ©gion des Grands-Lacs and HumanitÃ© et inclusion (Handicap International). / Ce projet vise Ã  accroÃ®tre l'autonomisation des filles, des adolescentes et des femmes par l'Ã©ducation, y compris celles qui sont rÃ©fugiÃ©es, dÃ©placÃ©es, retournant dans leur pays d'origine et les personnes handicapÃ©es dans la rÃ©gion des Grands Lacs.

With the Covid-19 pandemic restricting people's physical mobility and the use of cash for economic transactions, the development of electronic payments for effective public service delivery and business continuity has strongly gained in importance. While the digitization of cash has been growing over the years, the pandemic is a powerful reminder that electronic payments remain underdeveloped in most countries and need to be accelerated.

With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to affect indirectly 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education).

The objectives of the Project are to improve the environment in the outer areas/boroughs of Kolkata, reduce poverty in the low-income areas through affordable access to basic urban service, facilitate community empowerment through participatory processes, protect the environment from adverse developmental impacts, and help develop KMC as a proficient and autonomous municipality. The Project has six components: stakeholder consultation process, sewerage and drainage improvements, solid waste management, slum improvements, canal improvements, and implementation assistance and capacity building.The original project was for $360 million including $250 million from the ADB loan. However subsequently the Borrower cancelled first $30 million followed by a further $42.2 million due to declining value of the rupee resulting in a net loan amount of $177.8 million. However, due to unprecedented rises in the price of steel, cement, petroleum products and general civil workjs in India due in part to world prices, but also because of the booming Indian economy, the overall cost of the project works have gone up by about 30% in the past 2 years. In order to complete the original scope of work, on the request of the Borrower ADB has approved, a supplementary loan of $80 million.",Yes,0.0735663175582886

Maternity Clinic and Training Project,MATERNITY CLINIC AND TRAINING PROJECT,Somalia has one of the highest maternal- and child mortality rates in the world. Long-lasting conflict has damaged the health sector and due to shortage of professional staff and low financial resources especially the most vulnerable people continue to struggle to receive quality healthcare. Since maternal healthcare services are not widely available majority of women don?t receive any professional healthcare during pregnancy and delivery which contributes to the high rates of maternal and infant mortality.

The Clinic provides maternal healthcare for thousands of women and treats about 20 000 outpatients annually. The Clinic is the only one in the area operating free of cost and open 24/7. In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victims of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the project are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through training so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.,Review,0.0705607533454895

In addition to maternal health services the project aims to increase the awareness of health-related issues in the local community such as FGM HIV/AIDS provide support for the victims of gender-based violence through counseling and organize training to traditional birth attendants. Long-term goal of the project is to improve women's health in Afgoye and ensure women's access to quality maternal healthcare. Main beneficiaries of the project are the women receiving maternal healthcare and counseling at the Clinic and their children. Furthermore all the outpatients receiving care at the Clinic and people participating to the awareness raising are beneficiaries of the project. This includes vulnerable groups such as IDPs and disabled women. The results of the previous project phases show that the Clinic is providing vital source of quality care both to expectant mothers and other members of the community. Raising awareness about health has been successful and majority of pregnant women and mothers treated at the Clinic report negative attitude towards FGM. The continuation phase invests further to increase the capacity of local partner Clinic's health personnel TBAs and volunteers through training so that in the future they could take over the management of the project and secure other sources of funding.,Review,0.0705607533454895

F.a: Promoting sustainable business practices in tea estates,F.A: PROMOTING SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES IN TEA ESTATES,"Malawi is Africa?s second largest tea producer, after Kenya. The tea industry is the largest formal sector employer in Malawi, employing more than 50,000 workers. The purchasing power of the CBA remains far from a living wage. Negotiation between the workers and the national tea producers? association has proved a challenge for the workers, as the trade union is struggling to maintain the 15 % minimum threshold required to grant them bargaining rights. One reason for low union membership is short term contracts. In many tea estates joint consultative committees are preferred over trade union membership as they don?t have a membership fee. This has translated into inactive plantation level trade unions and shop stewards. Workers low productivity don?t support trade union?s demands for wage increase. #Significant number of women work in the tea sector, and they face several gender-based challenges like GBV, low job security in case of pregnancy and weak opportunities for managerial positions. The issue of harsh treatment and harassment by capitaos and the difficulties involved in raising these issues is an important driver of vulnerability, especially for unskilled women labourers. The US Department of Labor recognizes the use of forced labour and/or child labour in the tea industry in Malawi. Elderly people, people with disabilities and people with HIV/AIDS have an even higher vulnerability to low wages, as they tend to be the first to lose their jobs during economic hardships. Malawi is also really vulnerable for climate change and has experienced series of heavy rains, landslides and flooding.#The rightsholders of the project are 6,400 workers in 2 tea plantations in Malawi, of which 23 per cent are women. The goal of the project is to ensure right to a sustainable livelihood for worker households in tea sector in Malawi. The purpose of the project is improved terms, conditions and rights at work. The expected outputs of the project are: 1) Strengthened trade union capacity to represent workers, 2) improved worker welfare in tea estates, 3) Improved worker productivity, 4) Improved resilience and adaptation to climate change and environmental degradation by tea estates, 5) Improved gender equality, 6) Increased work opportunities for people with disabilities in tea estates.#The project is implemented by Fairtrade Africa in cooperation with the trade union PAWU, Tea Association of Malawi (TAML) and Oxfam. http://www.fairtradeafrica.net/",Review,0.0668694004416466

Supporting for Human Capital Development Initiatives,SUPPORTING FOR HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES,"Nepal is at a pivotal stage in its development as it transitions into a federal system. Despite shocks from the 2015 earthquakes and 2015?2016 trade disruptions, the economy rebounded to grow at an average annual rate of 7.3% during FY2017? FY2019. The government aims for Nepal to graduate from least-developed country status by 2022 and reach middle-income status by 2030. The recent move to a federal governance system mandated by the 2015 constitution offers opportunities to deliver better services for poverty reduction and enhanced economic growth. The key challenge for Nepal is using this window of opportunity to lay a stronger foundation for sustained increase in economic growth and provide jobs for its young and growing labor force to realize the country?s aspirations. Addressing these challenges requires diversifying Nepal?s economic base away from a heavy reliance on agriculture, remittances, and informal services towards higher-value industry and formal sectors, reducing the high unemployment rate (11.4%) and preparing the current as well as future workforce to be productive and competitive in the global market. Building a diversified and agile workforce with strong foundational and higher-order skills while simultaneously upgrading technical and specialized skills among new entrants and existing workers in the labor force will be critical to the country?s development goals. Thus, under the 15th development plan for FY2020?FY2024, the government has prioritized investing in human capital along with raising productivity in agriculture and industry sectors, and effective implementation of the federal governance system to achieve high and inclusive economic growth.",Review,0.0642752423882484

Improving the Role of Information Systems in Anticipatory Disaster Risk Reduction (IRIS),IMPROVING THE ROLE OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN ANTICIPATORY DISASTER RISK REDUCTION (IRIS),"Humanitarian agencies are able to use weather (and other) forecasts to act in anticipation of humanitarian crises.  For example, when a heatwave or hurricane is forecast, supplies can be moved into position early and emergency supplies positioned or pre-distributed.  This reduces the overall impact and the cost of responding to the disaster.  However, financing in advance of a disaster requires a high level of confidence in the forecast, to avoid the possibility of misallocated or wasted resources.  Many forecasts are currently available but not all are accompanied by an assessment of the forecast quality.  For example, it may be that the forecast is over-confident, predicting an event more times than it is actually observed, or it could be under confident, failing to predict events which do then occur.  We propose to develop and demonstrate a general method of measuring and displaying the information content of forecasts, using a novel idea which is based on existing research and freely available data.  This will allow humanitarian agencies to act confidently in anticipation of humanitarian crises when there is sufficient information in the forecast, and to implement forecast-based financing schemes such as insurance or anticipatory funding allocation only when there is known to be confidence that the scheme will be effective.",Yes,0.0607791356742382

Rational identification of therapeutic targets against emerging arthritogenic alphaviruses,RATIONAL IDENTIFICATION OF THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AGAINST EMERGING ARTHRITOGENIC ALPHAVIRUSES,"Arthritogenic alphaviruses are re-emerging mosquito-borne viruses that cause severe arthritis. Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), the most prominent arthritogenic alphavirus, has caused explosive outbreaks affecting millions of people world-wide. Currently, there are currently no available vaccines or specific drugs against the virus. Global spread of Aedes mosquito vectors underscores the potential emergence and threat of arthritogenic alphaviruses. The humoral response to CHIKV infection is key in controlling infection. However, currently there are few studies that have characterised human CHIKV mAbs from vaccinated volunteers, so our understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms induced by CHIKV vaccines is limited. The first-in-human trial of ChAdOx1 Chik in Oxford elicited outstanding immunogenicity. It induced neutralising antibodies against 4 distinctive CHIKV lineages and 100% seroconversion by PRNT50. The same vaccine also conferred some cross-protective efficacy against MAYV in mice. I will characterise the nature of the immune responses arising from CHIKV vaccines by achieving following aims:(1)Isolate human mAbs from volunteers in the ChAdOx1 Chik trial, (2)Functionally characterise a panel of neutralising mAb (3)Characterise the structural basis for how CHIKV-specific mAbs and broadly reactive mAbs target alphaviruses.

In the water and sanitation sector the global policy direction is formulated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes the targets for rural WASH as SDG 6.1 and 6.2. The project is based on the CMP model (Community Managed Project Approach): the communities are themselves in charge of the construction management and maintenance of thier water points. In the course of Phase IV the CMP model will be developed further to be modified towards higher technologies (deep wells water supply) largely triggered by the need to adapt to climate change especially droughts. CoWASH IV will continue in the same regions selected during Phase III: Oromia Tigray SNNPR Benichangul Gumuz and Amhara. The first phase of CoWASH project started in 2011. Since then the project has managed to build 15000 water points enabling access to clean water for 31 million rural people. Safe water supply and sanitation facilities has been provided for 967 schools and 419 health facilities. In phase IV the targeted number of people having new or re-habilitated/upgraded safe water supply is 800000. The aim is to increase the percentage of households using latrines from the current 42% up to 62%.

Investing in Inclusive Infrastructure/Investir dans une infrastructure inclusive,INVESTING IN INCLUSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE/INVESTIR DANS UNE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUSIVE,"This project aims to enhance provision of affordable and sustainable infrastructure services in low-income countries and fragile states to combat poverty and help economies grow. GuarantCo, part of the Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG), addresses the shortage of long-term, patient funding, and the lack of local currency infrastructure financing and local capital market development in Africa and Asia.Project activities include: (1) providing expertise and financial services to structure contingent credit solutions, especially guarantees, (2) strengthening gender equality, inclusivity and development impact considerations in project design and (3) enhancing the capacity of local financial stakeholders, investors, and project companies to make investment ready projects.Infrastructure projects often face high perceived or real risks or market constraints, including potential losses from borrowing in foreign currencies, making it challenging to obtain sufficient, long-term debt finance. GuarantCo seeks to bridge the gap between a project's financial requirements and the financial terms available from the market by using structured guarantees to help transfer risk, and use long-term patient funding. Its activities mobilize additional investment in low-income countries and fragile states towards the Sustainable Development Goals. / Ce projet vise Ã  amÃ©liorer la prestation de services d'infrastructure abordables et durables dans les pays Ã  faible revenu et les Ãtats fragiles en vue de lutter contre la pauvretÃ© et de favoriser la croissance Ã©conomique.

Creating diagnostic capacity for global health -  a technology-for-health partnership between Uganda and Sweden,CREATING DIAGNOSTIC CAPACITY FOR GLOBAL HEALTH -  A TECHNOLOGY-FOR-HEALTH PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UGANDA AND SWEDEN,"Diagnostic capacity building is increasingly recognized as critical to meeting global health priorities and contributing to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 by 2030. Accurate diagnostic techniques are the cornerstone of both infectious and non-infectious disease detection, clinical case management and control. However, diagnostic capacity is often discussed during disease outbreaks and then neglected once the immediate communicable threats are over. Disadvantaged populations often lack access to well-equipped laboratory infrastructure, sample transportation and rapid results, hindering efforts to control disease impact, spread, and resulting in a major source of health inequity. Here we propose a 2-years collaboration of the division of KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Nanobiotechnology division,the Mbarara University of Science and Technology, the Mbarara Regional Referral University Hospital and Doctors Without Border's Epicentre to build a sustainable know-how platform for diagnostic capacity building. In Sweden, we are currently leading technological advancement for life sciences with focus on resource-limited settings. Uganda has expertise in managing outbreaks, but when it comes to local diagnostic capacity, still lags behind. We aim at creating a stewardship program and a co-learning environment for a post-COVID world as we firmly believe that diagnostic is the third pillar of #healthforall, alongside essential medicines and vaccines.",Review,0.0494918487966061

The influx of Congolese refugees in Kamwenge has put significant pressure on social services in the district. The women in the project location areas (9 sub-counties) have the highest illiteracy rates (65%), work longer hours, produce most of the food consumed in households and are more vulnerable due to their limited access to cash income and resources such as land, which are largely controlled by men. Due to high illiteracy rates and lack of employment opportunities, women do not have the necessary incomes to address their and their family's needs and to break the vicious cycle of chronic poverty.  4. The main objective and expected results:The WINGS project will address the above-mentioned challenges and work with women, especially girls, from the nine sub-counties to increase their household income through savings and investment.The main objective of the project is to reduce household poverty for 75% of the targeted women so that they can meet their basic needs and are food secure by end of 2019.

ILC s methodology is based on the fact that a peaceful solution to the conflicts in the DRC can only come from the Congolese themselves.By organizing recurring gatherings over several days with influential Congolese actors at all levels and from different backgrounds ILC is working to enable participants to deepen their understanding of the drivers of conflict.The goal is to build resilience among local actors and communities by creating a more profound understanding of the existing social dynamics. ILC will work on reconciliation within and between communities.ILC will build on the momentum created in 2019 when a decentralized Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) mechanism began to take shape in North and South Kivu. Building on existing initiatives and leadership in peace processes ILC will work with the provincial commissions to strengthen implementation of local DDR solutions.Furthermore, the ambition is for participants to nuance their firm belief that they are not stakeholders in the crises that prevail in the DRC (increased accountability), as well as revisit their conviction that it is up to external players (international community, neighboring countries, etc.) to solve the problems. The goal is to achieve a higher level of awareness of personal and local responsibility in conflicts.The Embassy supports the project with 4 900 000 SEK during 2020-2022. The Swedish contribution is not earmarked to certain activities, it is to be seen as a contribution alongside other donors. Coordination between ILC, the Embassy and Switzerland takes place on a regular basis.

ICMP has worked in BiH since 1996 with the search and identification of missing persons from the war. Around 70 % of the missing persons in the country have been identified and capacities of national institutions have been built as a result of ICMPs work.The overall objective of the project is to accelerate the transitional justice process by accounting for missing persons from the conflict of 1992-1995. The specific objective is to increase domestic ownership of the missing persons process and to ensure continuity in resolving missing persons issues. Hence, ICMP will work with technical assistance to domestic agencies in the search for missing persons and with capacity building of agencies and support to associations of families of the missing with the aim to transfer ownership of the issue of addressing missing persons in BiH.",Review,0.0405236668884754

Also, the ongoing Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (SSW 2), which commenced in 2002 and is due to be completed in 2009. This has developed 275 subprojectsin 61 of 64 districts of Bangladesh. The Project will support the development of inclusive water management cooperative associations (WMCAS) that include landowners, land operators, women, fishers, and other vulnerable groups. The WMCAS should have sufficient social and technical capital to undertake small-scale water resources (SSWR) subprojects and to improve system operations. They should have clear financing partnerships and/or cost-sharing mechanisms so they can carry out sustainable maintenance. Within an enabling institutional framework, they should be capable of maximizing their collective potential to increase agriculture production in the subproject areas. The Project will have three outputs: (i) institutional strengthening of government agencies at all levels to support SSWR development, (ii) participatory subprojects, which will include poor and vulnerable groups, and which will enable WMCAs to plan, implement, operate, and maintain subprojects, and (iii) construction and maintenance of up to 270 SSWR subprojects and performance enhancement of up to 150 subprojects (out of 560 completed) from SSW 1 and 2 projects.",Yes,0.0388343334197998

It primarily aims at supporting the overall vision of UNDP s Strategic Plan 2018-2021:  to help countries achieve sustainable development by eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development and build resilience to crises and shocks . This will be made possible by providing support for the programmes s two building blocks: 1) About 80 % in support of specific UNDP-implemented projects and initiatives in three selected program areas, aimed at strengthening both thematic work, as well as integration and synergies between the areas: (a) Sustainable management and use of ecosystems, biodiversity and natural capital, (b) Sustainable water and ocean governance and (c) Improved climate measures for sustainable development, as well as the nexus area of sustainable food systems where all programme areas are included, and2) About 20 % of the support towards strengthening the organisational capacity and performance of UNDP to facilitate the transition to more strategic, integrated and programmatic practices that tie together all the projects in the area of environment and climate change and a stronger learning that put together are expected to lead to improved and more transformative results at the country level. The aim is to contribute to a programmatic approach making the whole larger than the sum of all UNDP-implemented environment and climate change projects and decrease fragmentation.The contribution implies that all global support from Sida to UNDP in the area of environment and climate change will be collected under one umbrella programme, including the two on-going contributions within water and oceans (Water and Ocean Governance och Ocean Innovation Challenge). All the programme areas are relevant to the strategy for Sweden s global development cooperation on sustainable environment, sustainable climate and ocean, and sustainable use of natural resources 2018-2022. In addition, the programme is fully in line with the government s strategy for cooperation with UNDP 2017 - 2021 and above all that UNDP should develop its activities in climate change, ecosystems, resilience and environmentally sustainable communities.Between 5-10 pilot countries will be selected jointly by Sida and UNDP, focusing on the poorest countries, to carry out the activities under the Programme s two building blocks. UNDP has proposed a preliminary list of 11 countries based on a number of agreed criteria. Thes include, country demand for the support, that UNDP has a large project portfolio in the country -  NDC support including support from vertical funds, a strong focus on LDC s and Sida s partner countries and that at least one small island develop",Review,0.0386204980313778
International Health Regulations (IHR) Strengthening Project,INTERNATIONAL HEALTH REGULATIONS (IHR) STRENGTHENING PROJECT,"The International Health Regulations (IHR) Strengthening Project is delivered by Public Health England and funded by ODA through the Department of Health and Social Care. It aims to strengthen international efforts to increase compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). To be compliant with the IHR, countries must build, strengthen and maintain the capacity to detect, assess, report and respond to potential Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, as well as providing facilities, services, inspections and control activities at designated international airports, ports and ground crossings to prevent the international spread of disease.Lack of capacity to meet the requirements of the IHR puts countries at greater risk from the threat of outbreaks of infectious diseases and other health emergencies, and has implications on a global scale if the countries are unable to appropriately detect, report and respond to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern.The IHR Strengthening Project works directly in partnership with six ODA-eligible countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Pakistan, Myanmar and Zambia, engaging with their ministries of health and national public health institutions to support the building of technical capacity and the strengthening of organisations, systems, workforces and leadership. This approach aims to foster ownership and deliver more sustainable benefits than if the countries were to rely on alternative short-term technical support.Through its work in the partner countries, alongside engagement with regional agencies such as Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network, as well as the WHO and its regional offices, the project also seeks to have a broader regional and international influence in driving IHR compliance and improving system coordination for global health security.",Review,0.0385940819978714

"Creation of an Effective Network of Basic Health and Rehabilitation Services, in Juba","CREATION OF AN EFFECTIVE NETWORK OF BASIC HEALTH AND REHABILITATION SERVICES, IN JUBA","The project aims at improving the health conditions of the vulnerable population of the city of Juba, capital of the Republic of South Sudan, with particular reference to the most vulnerable groups including IDP, and persons (especially children) with disabilities. In order to achieve such objective, the project will be developed on two different lines of action, with Usratuna Pediatric Polyvalent Center as pivotal structure.First of all, the Usratuna Primary Health Care Department (which includes a dispensary, a laboratory, a pharmacy, a vaccination service, a specialized Antenatal and Postnatal Care Service, and a centre the diagnosis and pharmacological treatment of epileptic subjects, unique in the whole Juba) will be the focal point of a network of Governmental dispensaries widespread throughout the territory, which will be supported, so as to create reference points for basic health, according to the standards of the main health document of the Government of South Sudan (the Basic Package of Health Services - BPHS). These include prevention, visits and basic treatments, referral of patients to secondary structures in case of need, pre and postnatal visits and non-complicated deliveries. Secondly, the services of the Rehabilitation Department of Usratuna Center, and its two outreach rehabilitation branches in the Municipalities of Kator and Munuki, will be enhanced with an important training intervention, and expanded in terms of availability of services (e.g. start-up of a new occupational therapy service), so as to increase the number of beneficiaries, as well as the quality and quantity of the services provided.

Consolidating gains and deepening devolution in Kenya,CONSOLIDATING GAINS AND DEEPENING DEVOLUTION IN KENYA,UNDP administered (in co-ordination with UN Women and UNICEF) support for devolution in Kenya. The aim of the programme is to develop and deepen the results of the constitution mandated devolution process in the 17 focus counties of the programme.  The outcomes of the programme are: Outcome 1 - by 2022 people in Kenya access high quality services at a devolved level that are well coordinated integrated transparent equitably resourced and accountable. Outcome 2 - by 2022 marginalized and vulnerable people have increased access to and utilize social protection and services for prevention and response to gender-based violence and violence against children. Outcome 3 - by 2022 individuals and communities in Kenya have reduced exposure to risks and are more resilient to disasters and emergencies.Finland has earlier supported the World Bank?s Kenya Accountable Devolution Programme?s Fund (2 million euro 2015-2017). KADP achieved good results eg. the Treasury?s  capacity to channel and monitor funds to counties has been strengthened as well as the counties accountability in budgeting.

Young girl activists to contribute in preventing of early marriages,YOUNG GIRL ACTIVISTS TO CONTRIBUTE IN PREVENTING OF EARLY MARRIAGES,Poverty instability and displacement of Syrians in Lebanon have led to the increase of child marriage among Syrian refugees as well as vulnerable Lebanese. This project implemented by Developmental Action without Borders (Naba?a) intends to contribute to the  reduction of early marriage in the most vulnerable and neglected communities (Lebanese and Syrian) in Akkar North Lebanon and providing a protective environment particularly for young and adolescent girls. The project is based on the recommendations of the previous project funded by the Finnish Embassy. This will be achieved through four main project components: 1) The first component aims to reshape the lives of the most marginalized Lebanese young and adolescent girls through enrolling them in a vocational training center to study a vocational profession. This might help them to find better job opportunities and prevent their early marriage as they are able to cover their daily expenses.  2) The second component is working on empowering and enhancing the skills of the girls to be girls advocacy activists within their communities at the local and national levels. 3)The third component will be focused on the parents adolescent girls and Community Members whom will be empowered and Enabled to take Informed Decisions and to become Agents of Positive Change in order to prevent and Respond to Early Marriage. This will be achieved through awareness raising capacity development for parents particularly mothers and community leaders on the child rights protection and the risks of early marriage. 4)The fourth component will be focused on the advocacy and lobbying where the community Leaders and influential persons including religious leaders are aware about the risks of child marriage and agree that marriage should not be contracted before 18 years in any circumstances.

Enhancing the resilience of alternative food systems in informal settings in Latin America and the Caribbean through bottom-up initiatives,ENHANCING THE RESILIENCE OF ALTERNATIVE FOOD SYSTEMS IN INFORMAL SETTINGS IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN THROUGH BOTTOM-UP INITIATIVES,"In Latin America and the Caribbean, as elsewhere, low-income and marginalized communities have seen their vulnerability exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. They are experiencing greater food insecurity and are suffering more from the cascading impacts of natural hazards and climate change. Yet every day, they produce informal, bottom-up solutions to these problems, transforming public spaces, housing, and urban conditions at the margins of the authorities' influences and plans.

The investment will begin in Amman because the completion of the billion-dollar Disi water supply system from southern Jordan will result in a substantial increase in NRW losses in Amman and requires a sustained program to reduce these losses. The activity will later be expanded to Aqaba and Zarqa. Through the use of a Fixed Amount Reimbursment Agreement (FARA) mechanism with Miyahuna, the NRW Activity aims to assist Miyahuna in decreasing NRW that is lost through leakage, illegal use, or inaccurate billing in selected zones of Amman through detection, repair, and remediation projects, and collecting the baseline data for possible future public-private partnerships in continued repair, operations and maintenance of the system.

GCRF: One Health Regional Network for the Horn of Africa (HORN),GCRF: ONE HEALTH REGIONAL NETWORK FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA (HORN),"One Health is the concept that the health and well-being of people is linked to the health of their animals and the environment.  It is nowhere more true than in the Horn of Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia) where many people's livelihoods are highly, or in some cases entirely, dependent on livestock. Animals are culturally, socially and economically vital in the region. Livestock provide, for example, over 60% of agricultural GDP in the Horn. Livestock are also a source of human disease. Outbreaks of disease in animals thereby directly affect people's health but also their wealth and nutrition.  Livestock production and human health and wellbeing in the Horn of Africa can be increased through research, leading to improved agricultural systems, more food and less malnutrition, more financial resilience, and better detection, diagnosis, prevention and control of disease.  HORN's mission is to improve the health and wealth of the people of the Horn of Africa by increasing the local capacity to undertake high quality research in the interactions between people and animals - One Health.  HORN aims to develop a One Health Regional Network - a network of individuals and organisations across the Horn of Africa that can undertake high quality research into the link between people's health and wealth and that of livestock and the environment.  HORN will strengthen the ability of organisations to undertake research with a 5 step process.  (i) First, the current research capacity of the organisations will be assessed, relative to their goals, a plan will then be developed to bridge the gap, implemented, and progress will be monitored. (ii) Following from #1, training will be provided to non-academics in these organisations that have roles that provide the foundations for research: these could be leadership roles, technical roles or other roles, such as in finance or contracts or IT. (iii) Training will also be provided to academic researchers from the region. Workshops and short courses (2-5 days), 4-8 week masterclasses and summer schools will educate researchers  in aspects of One Health, as well as providing the generic skills that underpin high quality research, like research methods, statistics, presentation, grantsmanship.  An e-learning platform will enable a wider body of researchers to access the course material. (iv) Researchers will 'learn on the job' by undertaking research projects of 3-12 months duration. These projects will be co-created (by discussion and interaction with expert academics) at group events ('sandpits'), with successful ideas rapidly agreed and funded. Mobility of many researchers between countries is envisaged, with research focused in specific parts of Kenya and Ethiopia. UK researchers will be based in these countries too, following research programmes aligned with the development challenges, and providing supervision and mentoring to the researchers from the Horn countries.

The diaspora have also acquired knowledge, experience and education in their new countries. The Somali diaspora have furthermore very active associations, they are sending financial remittances back and follows the political developments in Somalia carefully. The engagement is also reflected in the Results Strategy for Sweden s International Development Cooperation with Somalia 2013-2017, highlighting the diaspora involvement as a key part of the strategy. Forum Syd's Diaspora Programme in Somalia 2015-2017 complements the financial remittances by enabling social remittances by Somali diaspora organisations to strengthen marginalised groups and the weak civil society organisations in Somalia. This programme is also complementing interventions by international organisations and the UN by directly focusing on Somali capacity to handle Somali problems. The programme is in addition to this complementing Sida's other support focusing in the diaspora to IOM for diaspora experts to return to work in ministries in Somalia and a planned intervention focusing on the diaspora and the private sector. The engagement of the Swedish-Somali diaspora is also the foundation of the Forum Syd s Diaspora Programme in Somalia 2015-2017.

Under the main objective Forum Syd will focus on five outcome areas including: democracy and human rights, gender equality, sustainable livelihoods, regional initiatives (to enhance the collaboration between different regions of Somalia, focusing on civil society) and capacity building. This programme is expanding the sub-granting scheme to projects implemented by Somali diaspora organisations together with local partners in Somalia that was used during the pilot phase of the programme 2012-2014. In addition to this, the programme is expanded with a regional initiative aiming at bridging the fragmentation of the Somali society caused by the civil war through civil society engagement to build trust between different groups. The programme will furthermore support local partners in Somalia directly focusing on capacity development to enable more organisations to participate in the programme.

The project aims to develop ecosystem management plans for community forest user groups. Community forest groups have become less aware of their rights and many groups are almost defunct and under the guidance of a few community representatives. The project is being implemented on a pilot basis among women's groups and community forest groups in Kathmandu and Rupandeh districts. The beneficiaries of the project are 10 community forest user groups (comprising approximately 25000 family members as indirect beneficiaries) and 25 women groups (totaling approximately 1000 women). There are an estimated 2,000 direct beneficiaries, 70-80% of whom are women. The project aims at recognizing biocultural rights of indigenous people in resource management and mitigation and adaptation of disasters induced by climate change and unplanned development.

"Forward Ever, Backward Never: Documenting and (Re)Vitalising Revolutionary Agriculture and Sustainable Food Systems in Grenada","FORWARD EVER, BACKWARD NEVER: DOCUMENTING AND (RE)VITALISING REVOLUTIONARY AGRICULTURE AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS IN GRENADA","History, culture and politics have shaped the rise and fall of agricultural production in Grenada. During the Grenada Revolution (1979â83), there was progress in advancing agricultural development in Grenada, with women and youth playing a central role. Despite the progress made during the Revolution, however, agricultural activity has declined, attributable to a combination of several factors. These include inadequate policy and institutional frameworks that have not recognized and incorporated critical tenets such as gender and agricultural entrepreneurship, a rudimentary market structure locally, as well as the loss of preferential regional and international markets, inadequate numbers of skilled persons in the agricultural sector taken together with the complete absence of gender-responsive training within the sector, the lack of financial support for agricultural activities from almost all sources - government, private and lending, a breakdown in the social networks that support agriculture (e.g. farmers' groups), a grossly under-developed agro-processing industry, and finally, the devastating effects of hurricanes on the island over the last few decades. This project is constructed around a growing recognition that both the research basis (knowledge) and capacity to address the systemic agricultural challenges in Grenada are inadequate, and that getting to the heart of the problem rests on an interdisciplinary and multifaceted view into the country's history, culture and environmental exposure - with special emphasis on gender justice and youth empowerment. The project is designed to utilize a suite of complementary methods, tools, and approaches (Photovoice, visual story-telling, arts-based envisioning sessions) - from the Arts and Humanities and the Sciences (Natural and Social) - to undertake its research, build stakeholders' awareness and capacity, and bridge the research-policy divide. Fundamentally, the Action also seeks to establish sustainable partnerships both within Grenada itself and between Grenada and researchers in the UK and other Caribbean countries so as to ensure that the foundation that it will establish can be built upon in future initiatives. The primary beneficiaries of this Action are agricultural stakeholders in Grenada, namely 1) small-scale farmers, especially women and youths, 2) civil society organisations that have an interest/stake in agriculture, 3) Policy-makers and technical staff in Grenada's Ministry of Agriculture and Land, as well as other associated Ministries and public agencies, and (4 Research institutions in Grenada, across the English-speaking Caribbean, and the UK. It is also expected that the learning and results of this project could be of benefit to other small island 'developing' states, principally other English-speaking Caribbean countries, where the unique combination of approaches and tools utilized could assist in addressing similar agricultural challenges.",Review,0.0175852011889219

The project also helps entrepreneurs by providing technical assistance or in-kind support packages to accelerate growth and foster merit-based hiring practices.Training and/or business coaching is also provided to potential start-ups to help create employment. The project supports businesses in developing gender-inclusive practices to increase the hiring and retention of women. Additionally, an analysis of the barriers impeding women and girls from accessing skills and job opportunities is also conducted.The project identifies services that enable women and youth to overcome barriers to employment (such as daycare and transportation), and helps develop them. To address barriers that prevent women from taking an active economic role, the project is underpinned by community outreach to increase support for enhancing the skills of women and girls, and their expanded participation in the workforce. / Le projet vise Ã  amÃ©liorer les moyens de subsistance des femmes et des jeunes libanais, syriens et palestiniens de 15 Ã  34 ans au Liban, Ã  contribuer au renforcement du pouvoir d'agir des femmes, et Ã  accroÃ®tre la rÃ©silience des personnes, des collectivitÃ©s et des systÃ¨mes et leur capacitÃ© Ã  faire face aux crises rÃ©gionales et Ã  stimuler le dÃ©veloppement Ã©conomique.Pour favoriser une croissance qui profite Ã  tous, il faut travailler Ã  assurer la participation Ã©gale des femmes Ã  l'Ã©conomie libanaise, particuliÃ¨rement en offrant une formation et un soutien en matiÃ¨re de compÃ©tences, en apportant une assistance technique aux micros, petites et moyennes entreprises (MPME) pour qu'elles puissent dÃ©velopper leurs activitÃ©s et crÃ©er des possibilitÃ©s d'emploi, et en aidant les entreprises Ã  fournir des services qui favorisent la participation des femmes au marchÃ© du travail.Ce projet Ã©tablit un lien entre les jeunes et les femmes et le dÃ©veloppement de compÃ©tences axÃ©es sur le marchÃ©, en partenariat avec le secteur privÃ©, pour permettre aux jeunes de saisir les possibilitÃ©s d'emploi.

The area has been devoid of significant externally financed development intervention for the last two decades due to a 20-year insurgency, which resulted in a general deterioration in the quality of life of the CHT population. Basic socioeconomic indicators for the CHT reveal a region suffering from both low income and poverty, especially among the rural population. The Project has been designed to contribute to a reduction in the incidence of absolute poverty in the CHT and to provide a confidence-building environment to underpin the 1997 peace accord in which local communities will be empowered to decide on their own development priorities and actively participate in the subsequent investments. The Project will increase employment and income generating opportunities for the population, and result in a general improvement in the quality of life of the target population.",Yes,0.0168522354215384

Programme funding,PROGRAMME FUNDING,The work of KIOS Foundation aims to ensure that human rights for all people are realized and that states are committed to human rights in their legislation and implementation. At the heart of our work is realizing the rights of the marginalized and excluded groups and persons in vulnerable positions. The strengthening of civil society and in particular strengthening the enabling environment of human rights defenders and their organisations in developing countries is in the core of our work. KIOS considers that an independent capable and competent civil society committed to defend the human rights of all is a prerequisite for the realization of human rights and for functioning democracies respecting rule of law.KIOS gives financial support to human rights work that is planned and implemented by local human rights defenders and their civil society organisations and networks. Thus KIOS grantees have a strong ownership of their projects/programmes and often represent the specific rights-holder group themselves.The programme impact is a stronger more independent and pluralistic human rights movement contributing to the realization of human rights. This will be achieved by 1) improved capacity of the grantees to defend human rights in local national regional and international levels 2) Right-holders having increased abilities to claim their rights and participating in civic and political life in their communities to defend human rights. It is vital that 3) right-holders have increased access to justice and 4) duty-bearers are engaged and committed to advance human rights in programme countries. KIOS therefore 5) raises awareness and improves knowledge among duty-bearers the general public and other targeted stakeholder groups.During this programme period KIOS will direct its funding to East Africa and South Asia. The programme countries and focuses in East Africa are Kenya Uganda Rwanda and Burundi and in South Asia Nepal Sri Lanka and Tibetan refugee organisations.,Review,0.0150607908144593

It harnesses the wealth of expertise from the diverse constituencies of the disability rights movement as well as the unique convening power of IDA as the acknowledged global network of organisations of persons with disabilities (OPDs) and its close collaborations with the UN system and major international cooperation partners and networks. Responding to entrenched discriminations especially for most marginalized and underrepresented groups of persons with disabilities which are aggravated by the sanitary environmental and democracy crises the project centrally invests in developing the capacity and influence of the disability rights movement in Southern Africa in particular women with disabilities and other underrepresented groups including indigenous persons with disabilities and youth with disabilities. It articulates an intervention by for and with persons with disabilities building solidarities from national to regional and global levels to play a role as frontline defenders of the economic social and cultural rights of all persons with disabilities. IDA and its members in particular the African Disability Forum the World Federation of the Deaf Inclusion International and RIADIS as well as national and subregional federations of OPDs in Southern Africa particularly Mozambique Angola and Zambia will coordinate their efforts to address the underlying causes of discriminations and set the preconditions for more inclusive policy and program responses in the longer run. The project will make a direct contribution to Finland?s objectives including gender equality education addressing the digital divide and can be a flagship investment of Finland to advance its commitments on the rights of persons with disabilities through international cooperation.,Review,0.0148368757218122

DRiSL: The Drought Risk finance Science Laboratory,DRISL: THE DROUGHT RISK FINANCE SCIENCE LABORATORY,"Whether on television, newspapers, the internet or first-hand we have all seen the damage that floods, droughts and other weather hazards can have on people's lives and their livelihoods. It is a sad fact that such hazard events disproportionately impact developing countries and poor people.  However it is also increasingly evident that acting before a disaster occurs can save lives. For example, frontline humanitarian organisations and government agencies can themselves prepare by getting supplies and staff in readiness. More importantly, agencies can directly help the population prepare so that the impacts of a hazard are actually much reduced. Such actions depend on the lead time of a forecast but can range for example from distributing money, drought-resistant seeds, animal fodder to communities to ensuring evacuation procedures are followed. Acting before an event means they can also do this at a lower cost than the traditional 'late' post disaster humanitarian response. As a result there is growing momentum within the humanitarian system to move beyond the current 'begging bowl' funding model of post-disaster appeals, towards obtaining and distributing humanitarian funds before a disaster occurs. This change can enable humanitarians to mobilise more collaboratively, more predictably, and importantly in anticipation of crises. For this to occur requires trustworthy forecasts of hazards like storms, floods and droughts, and credible information on the condition of the people and systems exposed to them.      Forecast based financing and Disaster Risk financing initiatives, utilise information to anticipate potential disasters and set pre-agreed triggers for the release of disaster prevention finance. The advantage of this approach is that it is data-driven and objective. It thereby circumvents long debates around potentially conflicting early warning signs which tend to paralyse humanitarian action. It puts in place a robust predictable process to release funding or initiate action before a disaster occurs. Humanitarian agencies working on developing these systems face a problem, however. They are not scientists nor social scientists, but they need to use information from both realms of research to trigger the systems and have confidence in this information.  They also must be accountable to the people that the system looks to support and the donors that finance it. The START Network Drought financing facility (DFF) and the Weithungerhilfe (WHH) Madagascar Forecast based financing project are both at this juncture of selection and development of scientific data to apply to these initiatives. The DFF having begun the design with a Global Parametric model and have a prototype model that requires testing and evaluation, whereas the WHH Madagascar Forecast based financing project is starting out from the beginning.

The project's main objective is to strengthen the agricultural value chain, from farming to marketing, while taking into account women's and men's needs. Climate change resilience is a key element of the project in the three targeted countries. The chosen approach for the project therefore focuses on soil and water conservation, and on reducing crop vulnerability to unpredictable climate events, such as prolonged droughts, intense rainfall or irregular precipitation.Project activities include: (1) transfering production technologies (i.e., technical assistance missions carried out by agricultural experts, distribution of genetic material for artificial insemination), (2) implementing eco-environmental measures to ensure improved livestock feeding including installing hydroponic modules and biodigestors, (3) conducting market studies to improve marketing by types, (4) providing training in commercial negotiation techniques to organizations to improve agricultural prices, (5) providing technical assistance for individuals and groups to enhance the production, (6) developing customized teaching tools to ensure knowledge sustainability, and (7) providing training in leadership skills and public speaking, among others, to women and youth organizations.The Jules and Paul-Ãmile LÃ©ger Foundation (FJPEL) implements this project in partnership with the Union des groupements pour la commercialisation des produits agricoles de la Boucle du Mouhoun (UGCPA/BM), the Association Formation DÃ©veloppement RuralitÃ© (AFDR), and Action pour la Promotion des Initiatives Locales (APIL) in Burkina Faso, AsociaciÃ³n Boliviana para el Desarrollo Rural (PRORURAL) in Bolivia, and Centro de Apoyo e InvestigaciÃ³n para el Desarrollo Campesino (CINDES) in Peru. / Ce projet vise Ã  augmenter la sÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire des femmes, des hommes et des jeunes des zones rurales arides et semi-arides pauvres de la Bolivie, du Burkina Faso et du PÃ©rou, bÃ©nÃ©ficiant environ 35 000 personnes, soit 6 000 producteurs et productrices agricoles.

Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality,KNOWLEDGE IN ACTION FOR URBAN EQUALITY,"Urban equality refers to the possibility of attaining an even distribution of access to resources, services and opportunities, as well as recognition of social diversity and inclusion in decisions that affects urban citizens' lives. Increasing rates of urban inequality since the 1990s affect directly prosperity and resilience outcomes in urban areas. Increasing rates of urban inequality hold back economic, social and political progress and can contribute to conflicts and extreme poverty. In the age of urbanisation, with more than half of the World's population living in urban areas, achieving urban equality is a major global challenge. Three quarters of the World's urban areas are more unequal today than they were 20 years ago. Close to 1 billion people worldwide live in informal settlements, deprived of basic services and livelihood opportunities. The challenge of urban inequality has inspired a new global discourse on the future of cities and urban areas. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, the 'urban' goal, emphasise the need to deliver inclusive cities. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) adopted by national governments in Quito, October 2016, asks for urban policies for a city that leave 'no one behind'.  The project 'Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality' (henceforth KNOW) seeks to develop research capacities in developing countries and in UK institutions that deliver ODA research, to deliver on the SDG11 and the NUA. KNOW focuses on the major knowledge gap in global policy agendas: delivering urban equality for inclusive cities of opportunities for all. The work programme focuses on three key challenges: achieving prosperity, building resilience to disasters and a changing climate, and addressing the persistent problem of extreme poverty.  The work programme is divided in six work packages. Three work packages focus on learning-by-doing, that is, doing research as a means to build capacity. Work Package 1 will deliver city-relevant research in several countries including PerÃº, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Tanzania, Uganda, Sierra Leona, India, and Sri Lanka. In each case, KNOW will support the formation of a network of overseas and local academics, and stakeholders who will work together to identify the specific challenges associated with urban inequality that emerge in each city. Work Package 2 will use different case-based experiences to develop a comparative programme of research across cities, exploring the challenges of prosperity, resilience, and extreme poverty. Work Package 3 will focus on develop an 'Ethics of Practice' for urban research, within the framework of the Global Challenges Research Fund. Three work packages will focus on delivering capacities to maximise the impact of research.  Work Package 4 will focus on how to translate research into practice, working with key policy makers, intermediaries, and activists to explore the development of urban policy following the programme of research in each city.

Civic engagement as a vehicle for policy change in Lebanon,CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AS A VEHICLE FOR POLICY CHANGE IN LEBANON,"Lebanon is facing unprecedented and intertwined political, economic, and social crises. Public protests over a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit caused by economic and financial mismanagement have led to demands for political accountability, early parliamentary elections, and social and economic reforms. In parallel, the country's financial situation has worsened significantly, with the contracting economy threatening local markets, businesses, and livelihoods.  This project seeks to inform and shape policy debates on pressing political, social, economic, and financial issues in the context of the protest movements that have overwhelmed the country. The aim is to safeguard the interests and welfare of citizens seeking to negotiate a new social contract while assisting policymakers in the process of designing and implementing public policies and policy reforms.  To this end, a gender-balanced working group comprised of experts, academics, and key thought leaders emerging from the protest movement will be established to guide the project. The working group will guide the design of seven roundtable discussions with multiple stakeholders to promote informed debate and discussion. These discussions will generate evidence-based outputs in the form of policy briefs, videos, and podcasts to be disseminated to policymakers and the general public. The aim is to develop policy options, assess their implications, and guide national decision-makers and future leaders of the country.

Mitigating basis risk in weather index-based crop insurance: harnessing models and big data to enable climate-resilient agriculture in India,MITIGATING BASIS RISK IN WEATHER INDEX-BASED CROP INSURANCE: HARNESSING MODELS AND BIG DATA TO ENABLE CLIMATE-RESILIENT AGRICULTURE IN INDIA,"Livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves, with risks projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events, and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households to escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. Yet, to date, the success and uptake of crop insurance schemes across the developing world has been extremely limited.    Several reasons can be identified for problems in scaling crop insurance in developing countries. Traditional indemnity-based insurance schemes require time-consuming verification of actual losses experienced by individual farmers resulting in high transaction costs, claims disputes and delays that deter farmers from purchasing insurance. To counteract these issues, governments and insurers seek to develop more cost-effective and reliable tools to determine when, and at what level, insurance should payout to farmers if an extreme weather event occurs. Parametric insurance, for example weather index-based insurance, triggers payouts based on pre-established relationships between meteorological indices and crop yields, removing the need for expensive crop loss assessments. However, a major challenge for current weather index-based insurance is that payouts often are poorly correlated with farmers' actual yield losses, a problem known as 'basis risk', creating a major barrier to use of index insurance for climate risk mitigation.  In this context, how can scientists contribute to the design of smarter index insurance products that meet the needs of farmers, insurers, and governments? The overall aim of this project is to improve the current poor performance of index-based crop insurance by using state-of-the-art environmental modelling and big datasets to reduce basis risk and better protect farmers against weather risks. Our proposed research will develop novel weather index-based insurance contracts that reliably and accurately predict weather-related crop yield losses by combining crop growth modelling, satellite and smartphone imagery of crop growth status, and high-resolution gridded estimates of spatial weather variability. Importantly, our work will produce novel tools and approaches that address two stated needs of the index insurance sector: (i) to reduce temporal basis risk by designing weather index triggers that reflect accurately how yield sensitivity to extreme events varies during the growing season, and (ii) to minimise spatial basis risk by exploiting datasets that capture spatial heterogeneity in weather conditions, crop development, field conditions and management practices.     Working in collaboration with HDFC ERGO General Insurance, a major provider of weather index-based insurance for smallholder farmers across India, we will app",Yes,0.0097102876752615

Traditional buildings usually have the poorest performance, because of dilapidation due to age/previous damage and residents unable to afford maintenance - which will only be exacerbated by changing climate. This project seeks to adapt UK experience to develop an evidence-based methodology for cost-effective retrofit of the traditional housing stock in Turkey, to improve energy performance, satisfy user expectations of comfort, and protect heritage value. This will help communities suffering from fuel poverty improve their comfort levels. This project brings together a highly interdisciplinary and integrated research team: it builds on the UK team's expertise in energy efficient retrofit, climatic hazards and moisture damage, and the Turkish team's expertise in heritage conservation, site management, conservation policy and community engagement. It will bring together a wide range of stakeholders from both countries to review current knowledge of energy efficient retrofit, current UK guidance and its transferability to the Turkey, and the legal, cultural and technical backdrop against which retrofit operates. The 1st year will be used for data collection via field surveys, and modelling to provide a robust, quantified problem definition. The 2nd year will be used to establish protocols to enhance energy efficiency of the identified typologies. Stakeholder engagement is central to the project - it takes  resident experience/expectations on board while tailoring technical solutions, and its partners and advisory board comprise local governments, practitioners, NGOs, academia and policymakers to ensure knowledge transfer in order to facilitate the translation of PROT3CT's outcomes into tangible benefits.The project reflects a strong commitment to ODA compliance, and to the UN SDGs.",Review,0.00844203401356936

Improving Agricultural Productivity and Resilience with Satellite and Cellphone Imagery to Scale Climate-Smart Crop Insurance (Cultiaf-2),IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND RESILIENCE WITH SATELLITE AND CELLPHONE IMAGERY TO SCALE CLIMATE-SMART CROP INSURANCE (CULTIAF-2),"The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture.   Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture.   The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars.   This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.    This project is funded through the second phase of the Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF-2), a joint program of IDRC and the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

WOMEN FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RESILIENCE ? transforming fish-farming and forest value-chains in Nepal,WOMEN FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RESILIENCE ? TRANSFORMING FISH-FARMING AND FOREST VALUE-CHAINS IN NEPAL,The FFD project ?WOMEN FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND RESILIENCE ? transforming fish-farming and forest value-chains in Nepal? aims to enhance women?s income generation entrepreneurship and livelihood resilience. In Chitwan and Dang districts forestry and fish-farming are male dominated sectors where decision-power and access to direct benefits are held by men. Traditional roles low education levels and lack of targeted services limit women?s opportunities in these sectors. Climate and non-climate hazards aggravate livelihood insecurity and especially women in the marginalized groups are in risk to fall beyond safety nets.The project enables women to seize a centric role in terms of decision-making and direct economic benefits in fish-farming and forest value-chains. Farmers organizations hold a crucial role in breaking discriminating structures and transforming production towards resilient pathways. The project engages 18 organizations which commit to non-discrimination provide targeted services for women and boost the presentation of their 1200 women members? interest. New policy mechanisms are established linking women producers with local governments? decision making. Local organizations engage their members and communities (5450 men and women) to embrace rights and responsibilities and to seize emerging opportunities in climate-smart production value-addition and bio-products.Women improve resilience of fish-farming and non-timber forest products NTFP value-chains as the farmers organizations promote risk mitigation and climate-smart practices. Women identify innovations new products and services forming income generation opportunities and entrepreneurship.FFD implements the project in Nepal in partnership with Federation of Community Forestry Users FECOFUN Women?s Fish-Farming Cooperative Sundardeep and Forestry cooperative ASEC. FECOFUN is FFD?s main partner responsible for local coordination expertise and advocacy in Nepal. Sundardeep and ASEC implement the project activities together with their members and networks.

Satellite data for Weather Index Insurance-AgricuLtural EaRly warning system (SatWIN-ALERT),SATELLITE DATA FOR WEATHER INDEX INSURANCE-AGRICULTURAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (SATWIN-ALERT),"For the more than 200 million farmers in Africa who depend on rain-fed agriculture, drought is a matter of life and death. Their vulnerability is often aggravated by a lack of access to risk management tools such as insurance, which also limits their ability to take productive risks on their farms. Index insurance, where compensation is based on weather or area yield metrics, rather than on measured losses, is an affordable alternative to traditional insurance. However, index insurance will only increase resilience to climate shocks if the index insured fairly reflects the risk for both farmers and insurers.   Index design processes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, utilizing multiple data-sources and models. A certain degree of basis risk (where compensation doesn't match observed losses) is, however, inevitable as insurance is not designed to target every risk. Anticipating basis risk that ensues from the complexity in the relationship between meteorological drought (rainfall deficit) and agricultural drought (soil moisture deficit) is a key challenge for the agricultural insurance sector.   We propose a new system, SatWIN-ALERT, which can be deployed in real time to detect and predict basis risk events as they happen. As such, it could unlock in-season actions (such as increased monitoring), or allow timely post-season index assessment or action, enabling aid agencies and governments to anticipate basis risk events, and take action to support farmers who are facing uncompensated agricultural losses. In effect, the facility to predict pay outs and losses bridges the gap between post hoc index insurance and forecast-based finance. SatWIN-ALERT provides a means of combining the data issued by existing platforms into integrated assessments of droughts and subsequent compensation. As such, it can be integrated into well-established and trusted insurance design systems, such as the ARC risk viewer (ARV) or the IRI Social Network for Index Insurance Design (SNIID).   SatWIN-ALERT builds on existing state-of-the-art practices to take a sophisticated approach to basis risk management, allowing index insurance to play an improved role within climate risk management and development. We also bring together novel existing participatory and meteorological research to build systems that are suitable for operational use in ODA countries. To do this, we draw on fundamental research on monitoring of environmental conditions, and on recent improvements in forecasts - especially on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales, working with established partners to bring results to hundreds of thousands of farmers. We will focus on countries identified as important to our partners, specifically Malawi for our participatory research, plus Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Zambia and Ethiopia (amongst others) for our basis risk case studies.  In summary, the proposed project will develop a novel operational system (SatWIN-ALERT), which empowers farmers to benefit from robust",Yes,0.00652558030560613

Adoption of the 'fall cone' as the standard method of determining the index parameters and shear strength in South Africa,ADOPTION OF THE 'FALL CONE' AS THE STANDARD METHOD OF DETERMINING THE INDEX PARAMETERS AND SHEAR STRENGTH IN SOUTH AFRICA,"South Africa is classified as a third world country with a large population being under privileged. Consequently, the majority of the population depend on government to provide housing. Many of these houses have failed and continue to fail meeting expected life span. The problem is, to some extent, linked to improper foundation design due to location and soil type the houses are built on. With lack of regularisation of land tenure, the authorities are forced to offer plots on low lying areas which are dominated by shrinking-swelling clays - abundant in southern Africa - globally known as a major cause of damage to light engineering structures by exhibiting significant volume change in response to changes in soil water content. The calcareous nature of expansive clays in South Africa has also led to high spatial variability of physicomechanical properties, which has made the use of standard testing and design procedures challenging. Adoption of more reliable, rapid, inexpensive and bespoke testing methods â tripod partnership (industry, academia, and policy-makers) - will benefit from performance-based design and lower maintenance cost of buildings and critical infrastructures across South Africa. This project will expand the RAEng TASMIP technology that offered a reproducible consistency index parameter (liquid limit - LL) for highly variable expansive clays and silts. The aim is to verify the modified technology through testing on a wider range of samples from as many different regions of SA, before submission in form of a policy paper. Parallel work on determination of probability density functions for other engineering properties (e.g. undrained shear strength) will also be conducted. This should lead to full compliance with Eurocode 7 / BS EN 1997: Choose characteristic values for soil properties ensuring no more than a 5% probability of a limit state being reached because of the property under consideration.",Review,0.00605047214776278

Accelerating the adoption of circular sanitation demonstration systems for improved health outcomes (ACTUATE),ACCELERATING THE ADOPTION OF CIRCULAR SANITATION DEMONSTRATION SYSTEMS FOR IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES (ACTUATE),"ACTUATE will co-deliver two community-based pilot demonstration bioenergy systems in Ghana and Nigeria that will support an accelerated uptake of a safe circular water economy connecting waste, human health and energy, food and soil security. It will to grow transformational impact from the current Lancaster GCRF funded portfolio with West African partners and provide  practical evidence that working with, in and for communities will deliver the most sustainable solutions for waste management in sub-Saharan Africa.  Africa generates thousands of tons of solid waste daily, most of which ends up in open dumps and wetlands, contaminating surface and ground water and posing major health hazards. Waste is culturally seen 'not in my backyard (NIMBY)' issue. The mindset of considering waste as a 'please in my backyard (PIMBY) philosophy is at its infancy, if exists at all. Most people do not know, hence undervalue, the energy, food production and soil enrichment potential of waste. They also are unaware of the health danger of invisible enemies such as drinking water and food contamination from poorly managed waste.   There is a critical need to show that small scale, off-grid bioenergy systems do work, that they are sustainable and are capable of delivering solutions to waste management, power generation, food and soil security and improve people's health and well-being in peri-urban/informal and rural communities. The demonstrator pilots will encompass the collection of waste materials, their sustained processing through AD and the realisation of product values. They will be integrated into 2 distinct community-based settings: a small, domestic system associated with a community school in Accra, Ghana and a larger university campus-based activity in UniBen, Nigeria. Evidence from the demonstration pilots will enable potential investors and policy makers in both Nigeria and Ghana to have the technical and social evidence and confidence that these systems can work in situ beyond the laboratory. They represent the first and vital step for our partner organisations (CGE Nigeria, UNiBen, CSIR and LU Ghana) to take a lead in commercially growing business opportunities through entrepreneurial leadership in this domain.  The ambition, objectives and workplan for ACTUATE emerge from Lancaster's deep engagement with researchers and research users in sub-Saharan Africa through several GCRF-funded research and capacity-building projects. Africa is a strategic priority for Lancaster which is currently the only UK University to have a campus on the continent. In addition to our long-standing partnership building in Ghana and Nigeria, Lancaster University has grown national leadership in eco-innovation - innovation supporting both business growth and the environment.

Human-to-human transmission can also occur, resulting in outbreaks which may be difficult to control. CCHF virus (CCHFV) is a growing threat to naÃ¯ve populations, climate change as well as increasing globalisation are broadening its worldwide footprint. Turkey is the country in which CCHFV is most endemic with over 1000 cases registered annually. CCHFV is highly diverse: commercial diagnostics rely on data amalgamated from multiple virus strains and countries. In Turkey there is concern that new genetic variations of CCHFV have emerged which are not recognised by currently available diagnostic tests.The goal of this project is to develop risk maps of CCHF, improve local nucleic acid diagnostics, and examine any correlation between virus strains and disease severity. The project will bring together expertise on (i) tick vector mapping and entomology at Kafkas University, (ii) human CCHF disease, at Sivas Cumhuriyet University, and (iii) CCHFV diagnostics and genomics at the WHO-Collaborating Centre on Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers, PHE.PHE will update its published CCHFV diagnostic assay, create a panel of controls to facilitate accurate interpretation, and transition the assay to Turkey. In Turkey, biobanks will be developed for (a) ticks and (b) clinical samples which will be used to compare detection capabilities in serum, dried blood spots, urine and saliva. Viral samples will also be sequenced and used to construct risk maps and to assess correlations between disease and virus strain.The project will improve accuracy & speed of diagnosis, improving outcomes for patients and reducing risks to public health in Turkey. Better assays will improve efficiency of clinicians in diagnosing and treating disease. Biotech developments will catalyse economic growth and increase social welfare.",Review,0.00476066628471017
GCRF establishment of biopharmaceutical and animal vaccine production capacity in Thailand and neighbouring South East Asian countries,GCRF ESTABLISHMENT OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL AND ANIMAL VACCINE PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN THAILAND AND NEIGHBOURING SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES,"This programme aims to establish state of the art facilities and technology for the production of recombinant proteins, especially biopharmaceuticals and bespoke animal vaccines.   Biopharmaceuticals are protein drugs that are used to treat an increasingly wide range of serious diseases, to the extent that half of all new drugs are predicted to be biopharmaceuticals by 2020. They are usually produced in bacterial or animal cells, which makes them difficult to make and far too expensive for the vast majority of patients in developing countries. In Thailand, fewer than 2% of patients have access to anti-cancer biopharmaceuticals that are routinely used in the UK, and which are on the World Health Organisation's list of 'minimum medicine needs for a basic health-care system'. Cancer rates in Thailand are high and rising, so there is a profound need for these medicines.   Animal vaccines are required to combat infections in livestock, which is a growing problem in Thailand and other countries due to the increasing demands of growing populations. Many imported vaccines do not work well because they were raised against strains that are simply too different. Thailand and other developing countries suffer massive losses in livestock every year, with some outbreaks leading to 90% loss rates.  Countries such as Thailand can only address these problems by producing the biopharmaceuticals themselves, at much lower costs, and by formulating vaccines that are matched to circulating viral strains. Progress in both areas requires large scale facilities for recombinant protein production, usually in E. coli or mammalian cells. This is a highly complex area and most developing countries do not have this capacity - hence they need to import the products. To address this problem the Thai government has established a purpose-built National Biopharmaceutical Facility (NBF), built in 2014 and fully equipped for bacterial/ animal cell systems and product formulation. It has also developed a substantial animal vaccine research group.   The UK has world-class expertise in this area of 'bioprocessing' and this project aims to apply this expertise, initially in Thailand and later elsewhere, to develop the NBF into a state of the art facility that can make both biopharmaceuticals and vaccine antigens. The UK team includes experts in every step of the production chain, including design of expression system, expression of proteins at high levels, large scale cultivation, product extraction / purification, and product 'analysis'. The latter area is crucially important, any drugs licensed for human use have to pass extremely stringent quality tests that involve detailed analysis of the final protein product.  During the project a group of the UK applicants will work closely with the Thai team to transfer their capabilities to the Thai centres and build up production capacity. This will be aided by seconding the UK researchers to Thailand for long periods, and visits by the Thai",Review,0.00472873309627175

"Community, Science and Education: An interdisciplinary perspective for facing ecological crises in Mexico and South America","COMMUNITY, SCIENCE AND EDUCATION: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE FOR FACING ECOLOGICAL CRISES IN MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA","In Mexico and the South American region there is a need to share knowledge across educators, scientists, teachers, community leaders and policy makers in constructing ways to bring education close to the concerns and needs of marginalised communities. We will be working with communities facing pressures related to global challenges of poverty, health access, water supply and climate change. Our focus is on the strategic GCRF challenge of education and, specifically, sharing expertise in making primary and secondary education relevant to the socioscientific issues faced by communities in Mexico and South America. Initially we will convene work in Mexico and focus on the educational responses required to support communities in preparing for and preventing crises related to environmental and health pressures brought about by water shortage and water contamination. In Mexico and South America such issues are complex and related to poverty and access to services. Our approach is to bring together interdisciplinary expertise with the aim of proposing an educational response relevant to the local and specific conditions of those communities and schools. Our principled belief is that a normative sharing of 'best practice' or 'what works' (perhaps still the predominant approach) will inevitably fail to meet the specific needs of communities facing different challenges in different contexts. Our Network will begin with particular issues in identified communities and grow in a modular manner, incorporating other groups and other challenges and sharing the diversity of approaches needed to bring education close to lived issues. The Network will act as a repository for skills and expertise in which we stay close to community concerns, learning with and through those academics and non-academics who have experience and connections in the communities involved. We will be documenting our on-going work via a website, established and maintained in Spanish and English.  We will concentrate initially on two areas: rural communities from the Tlaxcala state, and, urban communities from Mexico City. Members of our team have been working with rural communities from Tlaxcala state since 2005, engaging in ecological research aimed at determining the adverse effects of environmental pollution on the health of children and people living near to the Atoyac River, the third most polluted river in Mexico. The team also has existing links to communities in the Xochimilco and Iztapalapa areas of Mexico City, where inhabitants face severe environmental and water issues. Having established networks with two communities in each region, we will then build to work with six further communities in Mexico, again engaging in immersion meetings in those communities, collecting our new knowledge at plenary conferences and disseminating via workshops to teachers and via work with policy-makers.

GCRF - Building REearch Capacity for sustainable water and food security In drylands of sub-saharan Africa (BRECcIA)',GCRF - BUILDING REEARCH CAPACITY FOR SUSTAINABLE WATER AND FOOD SECURITY IN DRYLANDS OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA (BRECCIA)',"The overall aim of this proposal is to develop research capacity and strengthen existing research capabilities in three sub-Saharan countries (Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana) in the related areas of water and food security. Climate variability has an enormous impact on livelihoods across much of SSA, where rain-fed agricultural production characterizes local subsistence and is the mainstay of most national economies. Coupled with rising demand from growing populations, urbanization, and rising incomes, climate change is projected to lead to cuts in GDP of up to 6%, setting the stage for migration and conflict. For these reasons, water security is considered one of the top global risks to development. Water security is also fundamental to attaining many of the Sustainable Development Goals, being a constraint on meeting a range of challenges including food security, access to clean water, and resilience to hydrological hazards. At the same time, attaining food security is a priority of national policy in SSA countries and is a key building block of development.   The reasons for insufficient progress in attaining water and food security are complex, but requires fine-scale, locally relevant research and solutions that are best developed and tested by local researchers and practitioners. Although capacity to carry out research in this area in SSA countries is variable, there are a number of fundamental gaps in the required skills and resources. To address these, our project will develop and implement a comprehensive and flexible programme of activities aimed at strengthening research capacity between the UK and SSA countries while addressing the grand challenges around water and food security. We will develop a pipeline of activities that is guided by a set of key research questions and implemented in the context of a collaborative network of researchers and practitioners that can sustain and propagate capacity and knowledge more broadly.   Our focus is on three countries in SSA: Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana. These are representative of different geographical, climate, socio-economic, cultural and institutional settings and challenges that will allow for comparative research and exchange of ideas, and the development of a richer collaborative network. These countries are also where we have complementary, ongoing university-level research projects and collaborations focused on various aspects of water/food security with institutions at different levels of capacity development. The programme of capacity building activities will be tailored to each institution and its goals through a process of co-evaluation of needs, co-development of activities and co-implementation, including south-south capacity building and knowledge exchange.",Review,0.0043617463670671

P209 - FRAGILITES - Strengthening University LGBTI+ Clubs,P209 - FRAGILITES - STRENGTHENING UNIVERSITY LGBTI+ CLUBS,"P209 - FRAGILITES - Strengthening University LGBTI+ Clubs - LGBTQIA+ rights movement is one of the most active and dynamic movements in Turkey and university-based student activism plays a vital role in that matter. University campuses are the places where young LGBTQIA+ students get the opportunity to socialize in a relatively safe environment far away from familial obstacles. Therefore, whether officially recognized or non-recognized, student clubs and societies are one of the most important parts of LGBTQIA+ rights movement of Turkey. ÃniKuir is in close contact with university clubs and societies. We were already aware of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on university-based activism since the education has been online for almost 1,5 years. The absence of LGBTQIA+ students in university campuses and them being mostly in family houses affected the effectiveness of university clubs. These student organizations have an age range from 18 to 25, and they have a high turnover rate, since members constantly graduate. For this reason, the organizational memory of these organizations and clubs were mostly lost during the pandemic, and the younger activists that lead these organizations lack the connections and knowledge of the previous generations of their club members. Also, it must be noted that one of the main functions of university LGBTQIA+ societies is that these clubs are the places where LGBTQIA+ students socialize, therefore, although several online events took place, this socializing function could not work for most of the LGBTQIA+ students.After realizing the vitality of the matter, ÃniKuir started to consider possible options to cooperate with these clubs and increase their motivation and ensure the survival of university LGBTQIA+ activism. We have realized that in order to connect with these organizations we must hold a physical meeting with them, since online workshops have lost their efficiency in the last few months. For this reason, we have decided to invite them to a student forum in ?zmir, Karaburun for three days. During this event, we are planning to have a forum and several meetings to make the clubs share their experiences with each other. The attendees will be selected from the already existing student clubs that we work with, which total 20 clubs. During these 3 days, we will host forums specifically targeting issues that the student organizations face, to hear their perspective and ideas about the post-pandemic return to campus. We will also give capacity building trainings in fields like advocacy and organizational communication to make up for the loss of information because of the pandemic. We believe that one of the most vital outcomes of this event will be the strengthening of the bond between student organizations and clubs, so that they can respond to crises collectively, and have a network of support between them.

IDRC's thought leadership in digital technology â Synthesizing and sharing evidence for impact,IDRC'S THOUGHT LEADERSHIP IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY â SYNTHESIZING AND SHARING EVIDENCE FOR IMPACT,"IDRC is a recognized global thought leader on digital technology for development, and these efforts are central to our mission of achieving a more inclusive and sustainable world. Through the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw the equivalent of several years of growth in the adoption of technologies transforming every dimension of our lives, and reshaping our economies, government services, health systems, government engagement with citizens, education, and the very nature of our public sphere interactions.   Many stakeholders are interested in learning from IDRC's insights in piloting, testing and scaling digital innovations that could help address the many new global crises?we face â from climate change, to democratic governance to growing socioeconomic?inequalities.  A recent mapping of IDRC projects confirmed that there are presently around 100 ongoing projects with a digital innovation focus, representing  investments of about CAD 92 million. The volume of research conducted by IDRC in various subject areas related to digital innovations has the potential to become an invaluable source of information to influence policy processes, innovations and practice to address key development challenges. Areas where IDRC-supported research has the potential of playing a particularly impactful role include: governance of data and digital innovations, digital innovations to leverage gender equality, data infrastructure and capacity strengthening, digital innovations for public health, economic empowerment, education, and climate resilient food systems.  The overall objective of this project is to support the development of a synthesis and knowledge translation (KT) strategy to capture and share learning from IDRC's investments in digital technology for development to guide national, regional and global policies and actions. This includes: â¢ Identifying potential research users, mapping key debates and avenues for uptake, as well as identifying knowledge brokers and knowledge sharing platforms to better position research evidence and programmatic learning for impact at national, regional and global levels. â¢ Developing a KT strategy for engaging knowledge users and sharing available evidence from across IDRC investments with a view to influencing policy and practice opportunities around digital technologies. â¢ Developing a series of papers that synthesize insights and learning on cross-cutting themes in the digital space.  â¢ A series of knowledge briefs, blogs and impact stories, written in accessible language to be useful for public, private and not-for-profit sector actors working in the digital space.  â¢ A series of knowledge exchange and policy dialogue sessions/panels, to be organized during/alongside major conferences/summits. These would serve as key channels for disseminating the papers, positioning our grantees for influence, and supporting policy engagement.

Investigating the feasibility of municipal risk pooling as an adaptation finance measure,INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF MUNICIPAL RISK POOLING AS AN ADAPTATION FINANCE MEASURE,"Climate change-related insurance products have been commonly used to manage the risks from climate hazards over the last few years. However, traditional insurance has not been effective for low-frequency, high-severity events. Insurance can also be a costly solution because premiums are usually inflated above the expected losses to guard against the payment of claims in the event of large or multiple disasters. Moreover, insurance requires post-disaster economic loss assessments, which can delay the mobilization of relief funds and their distribution to households in need. For that reason, in recent years risk pooling has been considered as a potential financial instrument.   Risk pooling is a risk transfer instrument similar to traditional insurance, however, schemes consist of several individual risk holders who wish to aggregate their risks. Some risk pooling facilities are now operating, such as the African Risk Capacity and Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. However, these risk pools face various barriers to country participation, including compromised sovereignty in terms of decision-making related to types of hazards covered and payout use, and an unwillingness to use domestic budgets for the benefit of other countries. A municipal risk pooling (MRP) facility is considered more appropriate, as it can avoid issues of compromised sovereignty.  Using the Western Cape province of South Africa as a case study, this project aims to assess the feasibility of a risk pooling facility at the municipal level targeted at managing flood risk. Project outputs include the flood event database of the Western Cape government, municipal risk profiles reports, peer-reviewed publications on topics related to municipal risk assessment and financing instruments, and a large network of insurance and reinsurance companies (interested in municipal risk pooling) to set the platform for a possible pilot supplemented by the findings of the prefeasibility study and scaling up. The main outcome of the research would be a pilot municipal risk pooling facility taken up by selected municipal governments for implementation. To ensure that the findings of this MRP are applicable in other contexts, the research will also develop a guidance framework outlining requirements and methodologies for MRP implementation. The development of a municipal risk pooling scheme would be the first of its kind and avoids barriers that have been experienced in sovereign risk pools.",Yes,0.00397787895053625

Regarding the COVID-19 landscape and travelrestrictions, we are not able to conduct field trips since early 2020. Therefore, we plan to implement a digital project.Project Objectives:? Creating and providing free, reliable and valid Turkish content about menstruation and menstrual care? Mainstreaming menstrual rights and the importance of menstruation care for gender equality? Raising awareness and lobbying particularly targeting policy-makers for enhancing menstruation policies bymoving the policy discourse beyond unjust taxation of productsKey Populations:Marginalized menstruators in Turkey including adolescents of menstrual age, low-income menstruators who cannotmenstruate in dignity due to economic, social, medical and psychological reasons, menstruators with disability.Problem Statement and Activities:Our field experiences clearly showed the need for informative content on menstruation written within the Turkishcontext. Existing contents are mostly translations from Western countries and do not reflect the lived experiencesof menstruators living in Turkey. We will fill this gap by creating reliable, accessible, and inclusive feminist contentcreated by young women living in Turkey for menstruators in Turkey.Our goal is to create a digital content in the form of e-modules (with available alternatives to be used offline) forindividuals and organizations (civil society organizations, student associations etc.) who work with marginalizedmenstruators, especially students in rural areas, refugees, and seasonal agricultural workers in Turkey. This modelwill create opportunities for local organizations while accessing the target populations. The e-modules will be titledMenstrual Equity and Care, and will consist of versatile interactive videos presenting illustrations, quizzes andguides/fact sheets that cover menstruation in two modules, (1) Menstruation 101, Menstrual Care & GenderEquality and (2) Period Poverty & Menstruation Stigma. We will publicly disseminate the e-modules via our Website.We will also create one YouTube video to reach a broader audience, launching our project and summarizing the emodules.We aim to reach at least 50.000 people via the e-modules.

We will refine and roll out a suite of diagnosis and dialogue tools that assess the resilience of food systems to stresses, shocks and crises in ways that allow stakeholders to identify leverage points for innovation and positive change. The tools are designed specifically to be applicable to planning processes in Thailand in line with policy commitments for agriculture and food industry. Training will be provided to local and national stakeholders in Chiang Mai and Bangkok, and an easy-to-use online toolkit made freely available. Our focus on resilience across critical systems provides a mechanism to plan for shocks and crises that are without historical precedent. The imperative to adopt a food systems approach is identified in the SDGs and in the Global Nutrition Report 2020. The current global health pandemic has further exposed vulnerabilities and weaknesses in already fragile food systems, exposing wider implications for Thailand's development and S-curve industry aspirations. The diagnostic and dialogue tools support stakeholders to map the totality of food systems, identifying constituent elements and their inter-linkages. From this systems-perspective it is possible to identify points at risk of failure or disruption, how critical such disruption or failure might be, and who might be impacted. It assesses the resilience of key components of food systems, allowing different stakeholders (farmers/producers, consumers, food industry, government) to present their analysis and reach consensus on the components most at risk, and areas requiring intervention. As such the dialogue tools provide a stakeholder-generated benchmark assessment of current levels of resilience as a means for monitoring and evaluating progress, and for prioritising resilience building actions.",Review,0.0038530312012881

By controlling animal diseases, negative impact on economic development, food security and livelihoods can be mitigated. For many important animal diseases the epidemiology is well understood, but despite that, effective control is not achieved. It is becoming evident that to control diseases, sociocultural, economic and political dimensions are as important as veterinary knowledge.African swine fever (ASF), is a severe and fatal infectious disease of pigs, with great socio-economic impact on rural communities in Uganda. ASF has been known and studied for almost 100 years, but is still uncontrolled in most areas.Using multidisciplinary participatory methods, the project will investigate reasons for farmers' responses to disease, such as social pressures, poverty-related constraints, and lack of health and veterinary infrastructure. The feasibility of sustainable implementation of control interventions at all levels in the value chain will be investigated, and the effect of stakeholder participation on the processes evaluated.

Concerns for gender and intersecting identities will be mainstreamed throughout the work, which will also describe the current operating context of knowledge workers, map the relevant stakeholders working on South Sudan's development priorities, and identify key research gaps.   The project will support virtual thematic dialogues with key stakeholders in South Sudan with accompanying background papers. Likely themes include governance, peace, and security, women's voice and leadership, internally displaced people and refugees, strengthening health systems, the food security and climate change nexus, and the education and science system landscape. The research outputs will provide insight regarding socio-political realities, key knowledge gaps, and opportunities to help strengthen the national science system, and they will shape IDRC's programming investments in South Sudan in the medium and long term.",Review,0.00353033607825637
ROTA-biotic: measuring the impact of rotavirus vaccines on pediatric antibiotic usage,ROTA-BIOTIC: MEASURING THE IMPACT OF ROTAVIRUS VACCINES ON PEDIATRIC ANTIBIOTIC USAGE,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) disproportionately impacts low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and overcoming AMR requires public understanding and engagement (1,2). The ROTA-biotic project evaluates the impact of vaccines on antibiotic usage in Zambia and Ghana. Caregivers in Zambia and other LMICs are often insufficiently informed about the hazards of inappropriate antibiotic use and AMR (2). This public engagement proposal aims to increase knowledge and awareness of AMR among caregivers of children under-5 using school-going children. To achieve this goal, we propose a youth-led intervention in Zambia where high-school children educate primary caregivers of under-5 children about AMR using narratives and performing arts. Our work will demonstrate implementation and outcomes of a process by which children will: Be engaged in the co-creation of a knowledge-based intervention with social scientists, local actors and artists, teachers of basic science, and community-based safe motherhood action groups (SMAGs) Be included in a research process, specifically recruitment, data collection and interpretation of findings, and Lead the implementation of intervention activities created by them and informed by caregivers and other stakeholders This will result in the production of visual materials and performing arts set/s aimed at educating caregivers on the concept of AMR and their role in controlling resistance in their children. Our work will facilitate broader dissemination of impactful AMR storylines within ROTA-biotic sites, schools, and ministries of health and education in both Zambia and Ghana.",Review,0.0034971151035279

At the IAF, we are investing in a regional effort that will amplify the voices of farmers and directly support their collection, analysis, and compilation of data that will improve the management and efficiency of their farms.

UBC is providing resource-poor farmers and their networks access to LiteFarm, a free and open-source web-based application, to use evidence to manage their farms sustainably. This will strengthen farmersÃ¢â¬â¢ ability to advocate for better practices and policies and engage with other funding partners. It will also demonstrate how community-led actions lead to more environmentally, socially, and economically-sustainable outcomes, such as food security, clean water, greater biodiversity, and resilience to natural disasters. The results of this regional project will inform agricultural support organizations (government extension experts, farmer groups) and policy-makers with context-specific data about how to encourage the transition to sustainable agricultural practices to improve food security, enhance farmer livelihoods, and minimize environmental degradation.

Pharmacological properties of triple antimalarial drug combinations in malnourished children,PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF TRIPLE ANTIMALARIAL DRUG COMBINATIONS IN MALNOURISHED CHILDREN,"Malaria remains a key driver of high mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Niger. Malnourished children are particularly vulnerable to malaria, and more likely to die from it. Malaria drug resistance to several commonly used drugs has emerged and spread. As a new approach to treat multi-drug resistant malaria, we have proposed to increase the number of drugs to 3 in malaria treatments (i.e. triple-artemisinin combination therapies, TACTs). Epicentre Niger is one site in a multicentre RCT evaluating TACTs, and is uniquely placed given the high rate of malnutrition. We will use Wellcome funding to evaluate the pharmacokinetic properties of TACTs in this critical population of malnourished children, with the aim of understanding the complex relationship between malnutrition and drug efficacy. This funding will specifically target aid for a vulnerable and neglected population, while providing evidence to reduce the impact of two of the most devastating crises in the region.",Review,0.00277191447094083

Ultralight Absorber for Remote Energy Source (U-AREs),ULTRALIGHT ABSORBER FOR REMOTE ENERGY SOURCE (U-ARES),"The proposed research will aim at developing and demonstrating the potential of using an ultralight photovoltaic (PV) absorber for access to indoor/outdoor remote distributed energy in Turkey. A thorough investigation of the full device structure to test device performance and develop a reliable and transferable technology, for ultralight weight PV, will be developed in this collaborative work. A scalable and environmental friendly PV flexible module will be developed with application consideration relating to the expansion of low power consuming electronic devices (few ÂµW or W) and Internet of Things (IoT). This research will benefit the vulnerable portion of the population, as well as increase R&D capacity of the solar energy sector.During and immediately following the project, both the University of Northumbria at Newcastle (UNN) and the Middle East Technical University (METU) will establish a R&D network including academics, industrial partners, venture capitals and SMEs in Turkey and UK (e.g. doctoral-industrial workshop on Energy Harvesting to be hosted in Ankara, Turkey). Within the next 5 years, the versatile solar technology developed in this collaborative work will also benefit stakeholders for commercial opportunities and the wider research community, by addressing some of the barriers to commercialisation of transformative energy technology using low-cost and non-toxic Earth abundant energy material, to improve the quality of life & have economic benefits to the vulnerable portion of the population (13.9 % below poverty line in 2017) in Turkey, in a post-COVID 19 era. Rural development efforts and cooperation will also be supported in order to increase living standards in the rural areas including those of migrants and refugees, considering Turkey's key role in international migration. The proposed systems will aim to create new job opportunities across Turkey's solar supply chain and reduce current high unemployment rate in Turkey (11.9% in 2019).",Review,0.00246241316199303

Omics analysis of density-dependent disease resistance in a major crop pest,OMICS ANALYSIS OF DENSITY-DEPENDENT DISEASE RESISTANCE IN A MAJOR CROP PEST,"Pathogens are a ubiquitous threat to all living organisms, and a wide range of defense mechanisms have evolved to manage this threat. One way for an individual to prime its immune defense is to monitor the environment for cues of an infection threat and invest in immunity accordingly. The most obvious cue from the environment is previous exposure to pathogens. Nevertheless, exposure to a pathogen cue is itself dangerous to a potential host and a safer alternative is for individuals to respond to sensory cues that predict an elevated risk of infection before exposure. These are termed prophylactic or anticipatory defences. Reduced susceptibility to parasitic infection in individuals exposed to cues associated with high population density is known as Density-Dependent Prophylaxis (DDP), a putative adaptive response to the increased threat from parasites transmitted in a positively density-dependent manner. In the twenty years since the DDP phenomenon was first proposed, it has been characterised in a wide range of 20+ insect species, including Spodoptera caterpillars, but the molecular mechanism underpinning DDP has yet to be characterised, and this is the focus of my proposal.Spodoptera exempta is a major pest of cereal crops and pastureland throughout sub-Saharan Africa, causing serious food shortage. It expresses both phase polyphenism (different phenotypes expressed in different environments) and density-dependent prophylaxis, to a greater extent than any other lepidopteran insect. Spodoptera exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpexNPV) is a dsDNA baculovirus that is host-specific to S. exempta. I will use the Spodoptera-SpexNPV host-virus system, using a series of molecular and other methods, including RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, RNAi and pathogen biological analysis, to study the differential responses for *constitutively* expressed genes and pathogen resistance in solitary and gregarious larvae. To characterise differential responses for genes that are *induced* in response to baculovirus challenge and differential virus resistance in Ã¢â¬ËprimedÃ¢â¬â¢ solitary and gregarious larvae. Furthermore, the key immune genes underpinning density-dependent baculovirus resistance will be identified.The results of this study may provide a novel opportunity to manage a range of important lepidopteran crop pests.",Review,0.00214302795939147

IMF Financial Sector Stability Fund,IMF FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY FUND,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Sector Stability Fund is a Fund for capacity-building in financial stability, integration and advancement in low-and middle-income countries.  Financial inclusion and financial stability are two closely interrelated concepts that both links to the financing for development agenda and the SDG targets. The G-20 has also highlighted the importance of both financial inclusion (Maya Declaration and the global partnership for financial integration) and the strengthening of financial stability (Council for financial stability (Financial Stability Board)), Basel III implementation and other regulatory reforms). At the global level, Sida supports a number of programmes that focus on financial integration but only a few focus on financial stability. Toronto Center and Sida s technical assistance programs with Sweden's Riksbank are two examples. Both of these two have an emphasis on capacity-building of government institutions of all central banks and its features.The IMF s Fund differs from these in that the capacity building the Fund is carrying out has direct links with the IMF s two other main mandates of surveillance and lending and is based on a holistic approach throughout the financial sector. FSSF s connection to the IMF s entirety creates an added value, of course, that there is a direct link to the management of financial crises and resistance to reduce the occurrence of crises, mitigate the impact of these.   The program is based on two main modules: -Module for financial sector statistics that help to provide decision makers with the statistical basis for the analysis of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial sector as well as the interconnection between sectors of the economy and the rest of the world.  -Module for financial sector reforms that will establish diagnostic baseline revisions, highlighting key weaknesses in the financial systems and institutional capacity as well as establish a prioritized action plan for financial sector reforms.       Similar to all IMF capacity development programs, the program is demand-driven, implemented by experienced internal experts and based on the IMF s long history of global commitment in this area. Genuine ownership is a prerequisite to be effective and achieve long-term sustainable results. The close connection to the IMF s surveillance and lending mandates also creates a unique opportunity for long-term sustainable results.",Review,0.00209870515391231

Strengthening of Financial Institutions and Infrastructure in Panama,STRENGTHENING OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN PANAMA,"This technical cooperation seeks to strengthen Panama as a reference International Financial Center by improving its regulatory and supervisory architecture and its compensation and settlement infrastructure. The improvement of the regulatory architecture requires moving towards a regulatory structure of greater integration more adapted to the particularities of the financial system in Panama, as well as to the challenges of the new products and technologies existing in the sector and that blur traditional regulatory boundaries. The compensation and settlement system in Panama has to be modernized, as it still does not compensate and settle in real time and is dependent on the United States. This makes it inefficient and highly vulnerable to systemic liquidity crises or phenomena such as De-risking. For this reason, the country must advance in the regulatory, institutional and operational framework to put into operation a modern compensation and settlement system.",Review,0.00209561758674681

East African GEOHealth hub for preventing environmental and occupational health risks,EAST AFRICAN GEOHEALTH HUB FOR PREVENTING ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH RISKS,"The burden of disease from environmental and occupational health hazards and climate change is a growing concern in eastern Africa. A significant portion of this burden is preventable, but most countries in the region lack the research capacity to analyze environmental health risks and assess policy implications. In addition, government infrastructure for environmental health monitoring, regulation, and enforcement is limited. To tackle these multi-dimensional challenges, this project aims to establish a regional hub of training and research excellence in eastern Africa with Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. The primary focus is to reduce the effects of indoor and outdoor air pollution, which is responsible for high and rising rates of disease and death in the region. The project also addresses emerging occupational health and safety problems from climate change in agriculture. Pilot research aims to analyze and reduce occupational heat stress in key industries of the region (e.g., flower greenhouses), engaging industry to validate models for predicting current and future health risks to workers. The long-term objectives of the project are to build capacity and leadership in eastern Africa for conducting cutting-edge multidisciplinary health research, extending a solution-oriented research portfolio to other countries, and addressing key priority problems in the region on environmental and occupational health. The project is being implemented under the Global Environmental and Occupational Health initiative led by the Fogarty International Center of the US National Institutes of Health in collaboration with Canada's International Development Research Centre. The overall research component of the hub is led by Ethiopia's Addis Ababa University in collaboration with Uganda's Makerere University, Maasai Mara University and Great Lakes University of Kisumu in Kenya, and the University of Rwanda.

Empowered through media literacy in Palestine,EMPOWERED THROUGH MEDIA LITERACY IN PALESTINE,This project is a continuation phase for projects ?Civic Skills via Media Education in Palestine? in 2015?2016 and ?Media Literacy for Sustainable Society? in 2019-2020 funded by the MFA. First one offered media education workshops for media students and professionals and the second extended media literacy education to citizens living in vulnerable areas and refugee camps. This project aims to empower young adults in Palestine to actively constructively and peacefully participate in building the society and democracy. The aim is reached through capacity building of adult educators working with the target groups. Thus this project emphasizes the capacity of trainers in media literacy and pedagogy. Also a guidebook for the trainers of media literacy and pedagogy will be produced. The aim is also to empower the local trainers by providing them with stronger but supported role during the project.  Altogether three courses consisting of 3 modules (5 days each) will be conducted during 2021 ?2022. The aim is that 150 Palestinians teachers and community leaders have been trained on media literacy. The participants have gained technical and theoretical skills in media production. To reach this goal 10 local trainers have been trained to train media literacy and pedagogy.As the courses strengthen the target groups? media literacy and pedagogical skills the project provides the locals with work opportunities and international contacts. Through their work with the marginalized people the course helps preventing radicalization and violent extremism. The local partners are Media Development Center (MDC) at Birzeit University and Institute for Community Partnership (ICP) at the University of Bethlehem. Thus the project is a continuation for the fruitful and long-term co-operation which has started already during the previous projects. The project personnel the trainers and course participants will produce journalistic content to be published in media channels in Finland Palestine or internationally as well as in social media. This will help to create a more balanced and fact-based views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for media audiences.,Review,0.00175271031912416

DETECTIVE: Dissemination and resistance mechanisms of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli,DETECTIVE: DISSEMINATION AND RESISTANCE MECHANISMS OF CARBAPENEM-RESISTANT GRAM-NEGATIVE BACILLI,"Modern genomic technologies and development of genome analysis tools have been successfully applied to improve our understanding of the emergence, spread, short term evolution, and transmission of clinically important MDR bacteria. Genomic analysis has allowed us to determine with fine scale resolution the role played by inter-hospital patient transfer in national and international dissemination of MDR pathogens. It has allowed us to determine the selective forces which drive the evolution of MDR pathogens in the hospital and within patients and the clinical impact this can impose. Genomic analysis has also been used to identify outbreaks, potential sources of outbreaks, and inform successful interventions to bring an end to outbreaks within hospitals.  The scale of the MDR problem in Chinese hospitals is reaching alarming levels. The incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with MDR infections in China has grown year-on-year in the 21st century. Most alarming is the rise in the incidence of infections caused by A. baumannii, E. coli and K. pneumoniae which are resistant to carbapenems, that last line of antibiotics available to treat infections with MDR pathogens. The national CHINET network of clinical microbiology laboratories of 34 sentinel hospitals across China (www.chinets.com) report that in 2017, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii were the top three bacterial species recovered from clinical samples. There were 13,337 known cases of carbapenem resistant A. baumannii (69.3% carbapenem resistance prevalence), 6,434 cases of carbapenem resistant K. pneuomoniae (23% carbapenem resistance prevalence), and 845 cases of carbapenem resistant E. coli (2.3% carbapenem resistance prevalence). It is therefore vital that genomic level investigations of these bacteria are implemented in China immediately, to allow the breakthroughs in understanding transmission, spread, and infection control that have been afforded in the Western world.  The proposed research to be conducted by the network will be organised around three independent but inter-connected projects:  1) Investigate the reservoirs and routes of transmission of carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae   2) Investigate the community carriage dynamics of carbapenem resistant E. coli leading to the continuous introduction of strains into hospitals and subsequent infections.  3) Investigate the reservoirs and routes of transmission of carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.",Review,0.0017364522209391

Avian influenza in Bangladesh: the role of wild waterfowl in disease transmission,AVIAN INFLUENZA IN BANGLADESH: THE ROLE OF WILD WATERFOWL IN DISEASE TRANSMISSION,"Avian influenza is a devastating disease for poultry caused by highly-pathogenic influenza A viruses. Since the emergence of H5N1 in 1999, this virus and later progeny viruses (such as H5N6, H5N8) have become endemic in parts of Asia, withÂ  outbreaks in poultry and few, but highly lethal, infections in humans. Highly pathogenic viruses are related to low pathogenic viruses that circulate naturally among wild waterfowl, and it is evident that highly pathogenic viruses can be maintained in the wild bird reservoir. And important question to ask is to which extent the interface between migratory waterfowl and poultry contributes to disease persistence. We propose to combine movement ecology of waterfowl with disease epidemiology of avian influenza viruses to investigate transmission of a highly contagious and lethal poultry disease at the wildlife/domestic animal interface in rural areas of Bangladesh. Poultry, both ducks and chickens, is an essential product in agriculture in Bangladesh, for subsistence farmers and for the expanding poultry industry. Outbreaks are devastating for individual farmers, but also has ramifications for trade. We will use the development in animal tracking to generate individual-based movement data of birds, ranging from smaller movements during non-breeding times to long distance migrations. The resulting tracks will inform spatial-epidemiological models to quantify persistence/transmission of avian influenza viruses at regional and flyway scales.",Review,0.00152626377530396
