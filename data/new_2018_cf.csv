NRC agreement HUM 2017-2019 - Repayment unspent funding 2017,NRC AGREEMENT HUM 2017-2019 - REPAYMENT UNSPENT FUNDING 2017,"UPDATED 2018This is a supplementary decision to the agreement with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) for their humanitarian program 2017-2019. The decision is made in accordance with Sida's contribution management rule, paragraph 3.11.3 and corresponds to the second year of a three year agreement.In accordance with Sida's humanitarian allocation process 2018, Sida proposes to support NRC's humanitarian programs in the following 21 countries, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Palestine, Somalia, South Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Uganda, Ukraine and Yemen. Sida will contribute with an unearmarked allocation per country, which will give NRC the flexibility to meet the most acute humanitarian needs in ever-changing contexts. However, in the specific case of Palestine, Sida will earmark the contribution to the ICLA-component, as this sector is considered high priority and as contributory to the HRPs focus on protection.  The support to Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo is suggested to span over a two-year period. This is in line with Sida's ambition to increase our partner's predictability, and allow for their long-term planning and alignment with a multi-year HRP.Sida assesses NRC's country programs as relevant in relation to the Swedish strategy for humanitarian assistance 2017-2020, as well as the humanitarian needs identified in Sida's humanitarian crises analyses for 2018. Sida is also suggesting a multi-year contribution to NRC's Rapid Response Mechanism, to allow for a timely response to sudden onset situations or escalating crises.   Furthermore, Sida suggests a two-year financial contribution to the NRC-led Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which strives to increase knowledge on the needs of internally displaced, and one-year contributions to the NRC/NORCAP managed project Strengthening capacity for use of cash- and market based responses in humanitarian action, to NRC's internal work on  Digital Transformation  and to NRC's work on humanitarian policy, which includes work to strengthen the global humanitarian system and NGO participation in the system.Sida also proposes to channel funds through NRC for the support of three NGO platforms, the Jordan INGO Forum (JIF), the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum (LHIF) and the International Association of Development Agencies (AIDA).  In regard to AIDA, the Consulate General in Jerusalem has the intention to provide support for AIDA within the framework of the cooperation strategy for Palestine. Efficiency gains can be achieved by providing the support through the NRC-Sida humanitarian unit cooperation agreement, and it is thus suggested that Sida/HUM channels this limited development funding, with funding delegated from Palestine Strategy, decision number XXX XXXXNRC's target group is mainly comprised of refugees and internally displaced",Yes,0.992490351200104

Access to Health Fund,ACCESS TO HEALTH FUND,"The 2030 agenda for sustainable development calls on the international community to prioritize the needs and rights of vulnerable populations, so that no one is left behind. The SDG target for Universal Health Coverage requires that the health needs of the most vulnerable people are met. The Access to Health Fund will focus support on vulnerable and  hard to reach  populations putting gender and diversity at the centre of its approach, ensuring service-provision understands and alleviates barriers to women, girls and minority population's access to health. The health status of the Myanmar population is poor and with wide geographic, ethnic and socio-economic disparities. The proposed intervention is a continuation of the two previous Health Funds, 3DF (3Diseases Fund) and 3MDG (3 Millennium Development Goal Fund) that Sweden together with other bilateral partners have supported in Myanmar since 2013. As previous Funds, UNOPS will serve as Fund Manager. The name of this successor fund is Access to Health Fund with the aim to increase access to quality essential health services for underserved and vulnerable people in conflict-affected areas, and to enable the health system to sustain these gains.  The Access to Health fund builds on two core priorities which are 1) focus on conflict-affected areas, and 2) focus on equity, adopting a human rights based approach to health promoting inclusiveness, and explicitly targeting underserved and vulnerable populations. The Fund is a multi-donor health fund, funded by Switzerland, United Kingdom, USA and Sweden. Access to Health Fund's total budget 2019-2023 is expected to be around 215 MUSD, where the Swedish contribution will constitute around 20 percent of the total budget. The thematic focus areas of the Access to Health Fund will be Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights, Nutrition, Tuberculosis, HIV prevention, Health Consequences of Drug Use, Health in Prisons, Malaria, Infrastructure as well as Health Systems strengthening - all aligned to Myanmar's National Health Plan 2017-2021. The National Health Plan was developed with participation from all key stakeholders, including the health organisations of various ethnic groups.The Access to Health Fund will concentrate its interventions in Rakhine, Kachin, Shan, Kayin, Kayah and Mon, all states affected by latent or active conflict and all with very low health indicators. The reason behind the Access to Health Fund is prioritizing services in these areas is because access to health services are extremely low. By focusing on these areas, the Fund will be targeting some of Myanmar's least equitable access-to-health situations and some of the country's most vulnerable groups, in places that the government often is not able to reach and support. Universal Health Coverage, the country's goal for 2030, requires access to health for populations throughout the country, and can only be achieved through closer cooperation and",Yes,0.991364002227783

Global Mine Action Programme Phase 2,GLOBAL MINE ACTION PROGRAMME PHASE 2,"Long after a conflict finishes, landmines and ERW continue to devastate people's lives. Around the world today, millions of people live alongside land littered by landmines, grenades, rockets and ammunition. This is a major threat to the physical safety of communities. In 2011, it was estimated that more than 4,000 people were killed or injured by landmines and ERW. The threat that landmines and ERW pose to development is even more far-reaching. Millions of people are prevented from using agricultural land and accessing essential services, such as health and education, because of landmine and ERW contamination. Their presence hampers freedom of movement, prevents the safe and voluntary return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees and obstructs the delivery of humanitarian aid. The goal of our mine action work is to build peace and security and support development in countries affected by landmines and ERW.",Yes,0.98972487449646

During the previous four phases of the HIPC CBP PDM, most of the former HIPCs have achieved significant reductions in their external debt payments due to debt relief, but the recent global financial crisis threatens to put more countries under renewed debt payment pressures.

"Kvinna till Kvinna - women, peace and security framework Somalia","KVINNA TILL KVINNA - WOMEN, PEACE AND SECURITY FRAMEWORK SOMALIA","In November 2015, Kvinna till Kvinna commissioned an assessment study focusing on the eight countries of the Greater Horn of Africa region.The study concluded that, while the Horn of Africa is clearly a complex, difficult and volatile region where the needs are over-whelming, it could offer many opportunities for an international NGO like Kvinna till Kvinna as there is a clear need to strengthen women's rights organisations in the region working within the women, peace and security agenda. Related to Somalia, the study specifically stressed the need to support civil society actors, especially women's groups at community level to connect and share lessons learned and best practices, build capacity, in general but also more specifically on UNSCR 1325. It further states the need to strengthen women's rights organisations in their advocacy endeavours (at the national and federal level) related to women's empowerment and participation, GBV and gender equality. These are areas where Kvinna till Kvinna has extensive experience from other conflict-affected areas. In February 2016, the outcome of the assessment was presented to a number of stakeholders in Nairobi, including the Embassy, and consultations were held about the potential niche and added value of Kvinna till Kvinna's presence in the region. Based on the discussions between the Embassy and Kvinna till Kvinna, the need for a more in-depth scoping study, focusing only on Somalia, which will inform the potential programming of a longer term engagement of Kvinna till Kvinna in Somalia for the next years, and potentially also the action and programming of other stakeholders and donors, was identified. The purpose of the proposed 6-months scoping study is thus to examine the situation and needs within the Women, Peace and Security Framework in Somalia, how these needs can be addressed and the specific role that Kvinna till Kvinna could play in meeting those needs.

Led by the Government of Ethiopia, with support from Canada and other partners, this initiative aims to enhance household and community resilience to shocks, such as droughts, and improve household food security, nutrition and economic well-being in Ethiopia's most vulnerable communities. To achieve these objectives, the project provides food insecure households with predictable food or cash transfers. In exchange for these transfers, beneficiaries participate in public works activities to build community assets and improve watershed management, a number of these activities build resilience to climate change. The most vulnerable beneficiaries (e.g. elderly people and pregnant and lactating mothers) receive transfers without contributing their labour for public works. The project reach is up to 10 million rural beneficiaries.Project activities include: (1) providing cash and food transfers to food insecure households, (2) conducting livelihoods interventions (e.g. crop and livestock production, and off-farm income generating activities), (3) providing key health and nutrition services (e.g. behaviour change communication activities), (4) construction of community assets (e.g. land rehabilitation, health posts), and (5) offering capacity development activities.Canada's support to this program is provided through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Bank. / Ce projet reprÃ©sente l'appui continu du Canada pour le Programme de protection des moyens de production de l'Ãthiopie (PPMP).

The project reach is up to 10 million rural beneficiaries.Project activities include: (1) providing cash and food transfers to food insecure households, (2) conducting livelihoods interventions (e.g. crop and livestock production, and off-farm income generating activities), (3) providing key health and nutrition services (e.g. behaviour change communication activities), (4) construction of community assets (e.g. land rehabilitation, health posts), and (5) offering capacity development activities.Canada's support to this program is provided through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Bank. / Ce projet reprÃ©sente l'appui continu du Canada pour le Programme de protection des moyens de production de l'Ãthiopie (PPMP). DirigÃ© par le gouvernement de l'Ãthiopie avec le soutien du Canada et d'autres donateurs, cette initiative vise Ã  accroÃ®tre la rÃ©silience des mÃ©nages et des collectivitÃ©s aux chocs, tels que les sÃ©cheresses, et d'amÃ©liorer la sÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire, la nutrition et le bien-Ãªtre Ã©conomique dans les collectivitÃ©s les plus vulnÃ©rables de l'Ãthiopie. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, le projet fournit aux mÃ©nages souffrant d'insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire des transferts prÃ©visibles de vivres ou d'argent. En Ã©change de ces transferts, les bÃ©nÃ©ficiaires participent Ã  des activitÃ©s de travaux publics pour construire des biens communautaires et amÃ©liorer la gestion des bassins versants. Certaines de ces activitÃ©s renforcent la rÃ©silience au changement climatique. Les bÃ©nÃ©ficiaires les plus vulnÃ©rables (les personnes Ã¢gÃ©es, les femmes enceintes et qui allaitent) reÃ§oivent des transferts directs sans participer aux travaux publics. Le projet pourra aider 10 millions de bÃ©nÃ©ficiaires ruraux.Parmi les activitÃ©s du projet : 1) la provision de transferts d'argent et de vivres aux mÃ©nages qui souffrent d'insÃ©curitÃ© alimentaire, 2) la conduite d'interventions relatives aux moyens de subsistance (cultures agricoles et production de bÃ©tail ainsi que des activitÃ©s rÃ©munÃ©rÃ©es Ã  l'extÃ©rieur de la ferme), 3) l'octroi de services de santÃ© et de nutrition clÃ©s (des activitÃ©s de communication sur les changements de comportement), 4) le dÃ©veloppement d'actifs communautaires (restauration des terres, postes sanitaires), 5) des activitÃ©s de renforcement des capacitÃ©s.Le soutien du Canada pour ce programme est accordÃ© par l'entremise du Programme alimentaire mondial des Nations Unies (PAM) et de la Banque mondiale.",Yes,0.986775279045105

The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the stability and resilience of 93 communities in the five states South Kordofan, Blue Nile, West Kordofan, White Nile and North Kordofan. The targeted communities were selected on the basis of a multidimensional poverty and conflict exposure analysis conducted by UNDP and are characterized by being on the verge of conflict, suffering from high unemployment rates (particularly among women and youths) and/or hosting large groups of IDPs/refugees/migrants. Limited economic opportunities and resource scarcity has further exacerbated development challenges in many of these communities and are likely to contribute to distress and conflicts in the near future if left unaddressed. The programme aims at building inclusive livelihoods and strengthen socio-economic resilience of the targeted communities by addressing the specific needs of e.g. unemployed youth, displaced population and women at risk.The programme budget is US$ 17,066,000.  Other donors include Japan, Italy, UK and Spain. The programme has recently (January 2018) entered into its second phase during which it is planning to reach a minimum of 9,300 direct and 279,000 indirect beneficiaries in the prioritized communities. Sida is considering a support of approx. 45 000 000 SEK during 2018-2020.The specific objectives of the programme are:1) To strengthen the resilience of unemployed youth who have the potential to be radicalized and mobilized to join conflicts by the provision of livelihood support and generation of the rural economy in the southern States bordering South Sudan2) To promote stability and peace-building by strengthening the resilience of communities hosting refugees and migrants from South Sudan and IDPs resulting from internal conflict by providing socio-economic infrastructure and assets to benefit all.3) To enhance the capacity of peacebuilding structures at the community, state, and national levels to continue promoting and engaging in peace initiatives, positive transformation of youth, networking and provide space for dialogue and learning.Programme activities focus on 1) providing alternative livelihoods for unemployed youth through, e.g., farming activities, vocational skills training, workshops and awareness raising, 2) replacement of basic infrastructure (e.g. water pumps) in conflict-ridden communities, 3) strengthening of community resilience and social cohesion, 4) capacity development of Community Management Committees (CMCs) and local government entities. Start-up support for local businesses, facilitation of linkages with the private sector and financial institutions, creation of short-term jobs and support to community-based initiatives will also form part of the comprehensive programme.",Yes,0.985374212265015

BREVE RESUMEN: El presente proyecto se enmarca dentro del programa global de actuaciÃ³n que ACNUR estÃ¡ desarrollando en Chad para garantizar la protecciÃ³n internacional de los/as refugiados/as sudaneses/as procedentes de Darfur, tanto de los/as que llevan largos aÃ±os en el paÃ­s, como de aquellas nuevas llegadas provocadas por la degradaciÃ³n de la situaciÃ³n de seguridad en SudÃ¡n. Su objetivo esencial serÃ¡ conseguir que los/as refugiados/as sudaneses/as en los campos gestionados por ACNUR en el este de Chad, y la poblaciÃ³n local, tengan acceso regular a servicios adecuados de agua, con un suministro de calidad sin cortes de conformidad con los estÃ¡ndares internacionales y vivan en ambientes salubres, evitÃ¡ndose de este modo la transmisiÃ³n de enfermedades. CONTEXTO: Desde febrero de 2003 se estÃ¡n produciendo enfrentamientos en Darfur, al oeste de SudÃ¡n, entre milicias apoyadas por el Gobierno de SudÃ¡n (JanjaweedMuraheleen y Fuerzas Populares de Defensa) y los grupos armados de oposiciÃ³n, Sudan People?sLiberationMovement (SPLM) y Justice and EqualityMovement (JEM), la mayorÃ­a del grupo Ã©tnico Fur (formado por las tribus Dajo, Masalit, Tama, Tanjur y Zaghawa). La larga guerra civil sudanesa continÃºa teniendo consecuencias nefastas en la regiÃ³n de Darfur dando lugar a un enorme estado de volatilidad. Chad es uno de los paÃ­ses mÃ¡s pobres del mundo, y tambiÃ©n uno de los que mayor poblaciÃ³n refugiada acoge en su territorio. A 28 de febrero de 2018, la poblaciÃ³n refugiada y solicitante de asilo en Chad era de 438.695 personas, viviendo en 22 campos, 13 comunidades de acogida y 2 Ã¡reas urbanas (N?Djamena y Bongor). La mayorÃ­a de las personas refugiadas son procedentes de la regiÃ³n sudanesa de Darfur (327.389 personas), aunque el conflicto en la RepÃºblica Centroafricana ha provocado un aumento considerable de poblaciÃ³n refugiada procedente de este paÃ­s. Ocupa el puesto 186 de 188 en el IDH. En este contexto polÃ­tico y de seguridad inestable, ACNUR ha estado ejecutando su Programa General en Chad desde 2003, con la puesta en marcha de operaciones humanitarias en favor de los/as refugiados/as, de las personas desplazadas y de las poblaciones de acogida, incluso si a veces las agencias humanitarias se han visto obligadas a restringir sus movimientos entre los cam",Yes,0.983864963054657

Description: In an increasingly connected and urbanizing world, disease outbreaks are a growing risk to people's lives and livelihoods. As illustrated by recent pandemics, such as SARS, Ebola and Zika virus, they also have significant impact on economies and challenge health infrastructures. They require coordination and increased efforts at the national, regional and global level to ensure we're better prepared for future outbreaks. Addressing epidemics and other health emergencies is one of the WHO's three core priorities in its new General Programme of Work (2019-2023). In 2015, WHO established the R & D Blueprint, which outlined a global strategy and plan to allow the rapid activation of R & D activities during epidemics. A large focus is to coordinate global efforts in developing effective diagnostics, medicines and vaccines for outbreaks to save lives and avert large scale crises. The Blueprint works with national governments, UN agencies, civil society, funders and the private sector to improve coordination, accelerate processes and develop tailored norms and standards.

WaterAid,WATERAID,"Summary: As many as two million people live in informal settlements in Kampala, with the slums of Central, Nakawa, and Kawempe Divisions regarded as the most vulnerable in terms of flood risk and levels of poverty. Although access to clean water and public latrines has been improving in some areas through government and NGO efforts, the majority of residents still lack access to decent affordable water supply and sanitation services. Three in every four illnesses are water borne or preventable, accounting for 17% of deaths in children under-five. Many schools lack even basic facilities let alone separate latrines allowing privacy and appropriate segregation for girls and boys. Building on a project already underway with funding from Comic Relief in Kawempe, WaterAid now plans to replicate this work in Central and Nakawa Divisions. The extension project will see construction of water catchment tanks and separate latrine facilities in 30 schools, benefiting a total of 24,000 children, especially girls. At the same time, public information and training programmes will increase hygiene understanding amongst school children and wider communities, promote the construction of household latrines and give a voice to slum dwellers as they hold local authorities to account and work to further improve living conditions. An extension of the current project for two more years in Kawempe will help ensure a legacy of improved health, living conditions and water and sanitation services across slums in three Divisions of Kampala. The government of the UK (DfID) funded 50 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics.

Transportation base for the distribution of food aid to the Sahrawi refugees,TRANSPORTATION BASE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD AID TO THE SAHRAWI REFUGEES,"TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: Base de transporte para la distribuciÃ³n de ayuda alimentaria a los refugiados saharauis :: El proyecto forma parte de una intervenciÃ³n que tiene por objeto garantizar un sistema seguro y estable de distribuciÃ³n de la ayuda alimentaria en los Campamentos de PoblaciÃ³n Refugiada Saharaui, ubicados en el desierto del sur de Argelia junto a Tindouf. El objetivo Ãºltimo del proyecto es contribuir de forma eficiente la cobertura de las necesidades alimentarias de la poblaciÃ³n refugiada saharaui. La pertinencia de la acciÃ³n se basa en la necesidad primaria de alimento por parte de una poblaciÃ³n que, debido a su status de refugiada y teniendo en cuenta las caracterÃ­sticas totalmente improductivas del terreno, es totalmente dependiente de la ayuda exterior. La Bases de Transportes (BdT) nace como respuesta a la necesidad de distribuir la ayuda alimentaria desde los almacenes centrales de Media Luna Roja Saharaui MLRS hasta cada uno de los 5 diferentes campos que se encuentran mÃ¡s o menos distantes (desde los 11 km del mÃ¡s cercano hasta los 152 del mÃ¡s lejano)Tras 13 aÃ±os de funcionamiento, la BdT cuenta con un equipo humano conformado por 46 personas entre chÃ³feres, mecÃ¡nicos, soldadores, administrativos y personal de apoyo (vigilantes, cocinero, etc). Igualmente se cuenta con 21 vehÃ­culos de transporte asignados de los cuales 17 (de ellos 11 rÃ­gidos y 6 trÃ¡iler) realizan funciones de reparto de alimentos con una capacidad de carga teÃ³rica de 292 Tn/dÃ­a. Entre enero de 2017 y febrero de 2018, la BdT cumpliÃ³ el objetivo planificado distribuyendo el 100% de los alimentos al 100% de la poblaciÃ³n refugiada saharaui transportando 28.785,62Tm de ?Producto Fresco? en 445 viajes. Adicionalmente, en septiembre de 2017 se pudo responder a la solicitud extraordinaria de vehÃ­culos para la distribuciÃ³n de jaimas realizada por el Ministerio de Equipamiento con un total de 35 viajes sin perjuicio para la distribuciÃ³n alimentaria. Igualmente, durante el 2017 se realizaron un total de 7 viajes de distribuciÃ³n de mantas y durante los primeros meses de 20018 se ha realizado un viaje de distribuciÃ³n de depÃ³sitos de agua y 9 viajes para la distribuciÃ³n de 1.005 jaimas.En ningÃºn momento la distribuciÃ³n alimentaria se viÃ³ interrumpida por falta de vehÃ­culos o averÃ­as en ruta gracias a una disponibilidad de flota del 79.57%. Todo ello se pudo realizar gracias a un eficiente trabajo de mantenimiento preventivo y correctivo, habiÃ©ndose realizado durante este periodo 218 Ã³rdenes de mantenimiento preventivo de las 238 programadas (91,6 %) y 676 intervenciones correctivas o reparaciones. Los principales retos que afronta el proyecto en la actualidad son continuar distribuyendo el 100% de los alimentos, consolidar la distribuciÃ³n de non food Ã­tems y, como novedad, lograr asumir a lo largo del 2018 en una primera fase, la destrucciÃ³n del gas en las Wilayas de Bojador y Auserd.

"Famines as Mass Atrocities: Reconsidering Violence, Memory and Justice in Relation to Hunger","FAMINES AS MASS ATROCITIES: RECONSIDERING VIOLENCE, MEMORY AND JUSTICE IN RELATION TO HUNGER","Hunger is on the rise globally. Although mass-starvation has killed staggering numbers of people, it is usually not conceptualized as mass-violence. Victims are rarely commemorated and actors responsible are not held accountable â despite the fact that famines are largely man-made. The proposed project aims to analyze the attempts and possibilities to pursue remembrance and justice after famines. It studies (1) under what conditions, how and by whom famines are understood, remembered and dealt with as mass-atrocities. This is done through a historical study of six famines in Africa, Asia and Europe. The project also analyzes (2) contemporary initiatives to push for remembrance and justice for hunger deaths, for instance by intergovernmental organizations, civil society groups, legal professionals, victim groups and states. Theoretically, the project understands conceptualizations of violence, memorialization and pursuit of justice as interconnected. Methodologically, the project will draw on earlier literature, archival research and media sources, and also carry out interviews with experts and key actors involved in projects ofÂ commemoration andÂ justice.Â Bringing attention to the structural violence of famines, and gaining a systematic understanding of the opportunities and obstacles to bring those responsible to justice and commemorate victims will contribute to the important endeavor of preventing famines in the future.",Yes,0.976818561553955

"Improving health, defending minors and empowering women","IMPROVING HEALTH, DEFENDING MINORS AND EMPOWERING WOMEN","TÃ­tulo completo del proyecto: 2017-LANK-23. Mejora de la salud, defensa de menores y empoderamiento de la mujer :: El proyecto se llevarÃ¡ a cabo desde el Centro MÃ©dico Social WalÃ©, situado en el barrio de Dioulabougou de Yamoussoukro, capital polÃ­tica de Costa de MÃ¡rfil.                     La situaciÃ³n actual de la regiÃ³n de Yamoussoukro viene marcada por la grave crisis sociopolÃ­tica en la que se vio sumergida Costa de Marfil desde 1999. A partir de ese momento hubo en el paÃ­s un flujo muy importante de habitantes que huÃ­an de la guerra desde las regiones del norte, lo que provocÃ³ un crecimiento desmesurado de la poblaciÃ³n. A raÃ­z de la crisis el gobierno no ha podido responder con polÃ­ticas para adaptar las infraestructuras al gran incremento de poblaciÃ³n, trayendo como consecuencia un dÃ©ficit en infraestructura educativa y sanitaria.                                            Por ello el proyecto pretende mejorar la cobertura sanitaria de la regiÃ³n, principalmente de los y las menores en situaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidad a causa del SIDA a travÃ©s de la potenciaciÃ³n de la capacidad tÃ©cnica del Centro MÃ©dico-Social WalÃ©. Para ello se desarrollarÃ¡n siete resultados con sus correspondientes actividades:                      1. Reforzar la capacidad tÃ©cnica del laboratorio del Centro WalÃ© mediante la implementaciÃ³n del equipo informÃ¡tico integrado con los equipos mÃ©dicos. Para ello se comprarÃ¡ e instalarÃ¡ el equipo informÃ¡tico y se formarÃ¡ al equipo tÃ©cnico.                2. Informatizar el servicio de radiologÃ­a mÃ©dica del Centro WalÃ©. Para ello se comprarÃ¡ e instalarÃ¡ el sistema de informatizaciÃ³n del equipo de diagnÃ³stico por imÃ¡genes y se capacitarÃ¡ al personal.                             3. Mejorar las capacidades tÃ©cnicas del personal sanitario. Para ello se equiparÃ¡ la sala polivalente para las formaciones y se formarÃ¡ a 20 mujeres en seguimiento de enfermos de VIH-SIDA, informÃ¡tica aplicada a la salud e informÃ¡tica de los anÃ¡lisis clÃ­nicos. 4. Promover el empoderamiento de la mujer rural y la promociÃ³n de sus derechos a travÃ©s de la capacitaciÃ³n de 100  lideresas en salud.                            5.

Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project,GUANGXI WUZHOU URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT,"Wuzhou city is a medium-sized city in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou. The outcomes of the Project include improved environmental management through the enhanced disaster management and infrastructure and improved municipal services, particularly in the areas of wastewater management and solid waste management.",Yes,0.973655641078949

Quick Impact Projects in Lebanon,QUICK IMPACT PROJECTS IN LEBANON,Quick Impact Projects in Lebanon support the development of local communities in Southern Lebanon and thereby enhance the trust between the UNIFIL troops and the local population which is essential in order to provide a favorable operational environment for the troops. The UNIFIL troops seek ensuring stability in the area. Southern Lebanon continues to suffer from the damages caused by the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Lebanon hosts some one million Syrian refugees which also has an impact on the overall situation in the country. The 19 projects that were implemented in 2017 helped improving irrigation systems as well as provision of drinking water and electricity. Also various trainings and recreational activities were offered. Results are positive. The projects have allowed enhancing the trust between the troops and the local communities and at the same time for instance for improving access to water and energy as well as the situation of vulnerable groups. In 2018 the focus will be in water electricity and infrastructure projects and in equipping health centers schools and kindergartens. Education and recreational activities will be continued.

Preparing the Khatlon Province Flood Management Project,PREPARING THE KHATLON PROVINCE FLOOD MANAGEMENT PROJECT,"Tajikistan is susceptible to natural disasters, particularly floods. The floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing 32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at $55 million. The Project aims to help Tajikistan address recurring flood risks through a holistic and coordinated approach involving both physical and non-physical measures in one of the most floodprone areas in the country - Hamadoni, Farkhor, Kulyab, and Vose districts in Khatlon province. A major part of the Project funds will be used for the physical works for the rehabilitation of 8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In addition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, strengthen flood warning systems, prepare a flood preparedness and evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by rehabilitating the hydrometeorological network. Given that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the possible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan were examined. The initial environment examination study found that there is unlikely to be significant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on ecological resources and socioeconomic conditions in the area. In addition, the project will help the Government define and implement the policy reforms needed to improve its flood preparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and maintenance (O&M) funding constraints for the flood levees and bank protection works.The Project will strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the local government bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to applyneed-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for the flood protection structures.

Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility - LoCAL - Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility- LoCAL,LOCAL CLIMATE ADAPTIVE LIVING FACILITY - LOCAL - LOCAL CLIMATE ADAPTIVE LIVING FACILITY- LOCAL,"Mozambique's climate provides challenges in the form of droughts, floods and cyclones. Global climate change brings more extreme weather events, which means increased risk for and problems with unstable food production and food security, water stress, increased sea levels, catastrophes, changing ecosystems, lack of biodiversity, and human health. Mozambique's chances to achieve goals for sustainable development are at risk if climate change adaptation is not addressed, not least at the local level. Local Adaptation Plans (LAPs/PLAs) have been developed in the country's vulnerable districts, but they are mostly not being implemented due to lack of funds and other capacities, It is however a priority that they be implemented.UNCDF has since 2011, at global level, run the programme LoCAL (Local Climate Adaptive Living) to deliver climate finance solutions for local governments in developing countries, partially using Swedish funding through Sida (54040181 Financial Inclusion, 54020137 Leveraging Domestic Finance and 61050459 Last Mile Financing Trust Fund (ongoing)). The programme is now being replicated at country level in Asia and in Africa. In Mozambique, UNCDF developed a country programmatic framework and initiated a pilot project in Gaza province starting 2015, with additional financing from the Belgian Cooperation. The proposed contribution  Local Climate Adaptive Living - LoCAL Mozambique  is a first upscaling phase of the already ongoing pilot project. It aims to reduce the vulnerability of the rural population and improve resilience to climate change at district level through increase in access to climate change adaptation financing through performance-based climate resilient grants (PBCRGs). The main expected results are (in short):1. Effective financing mechanism established and operationalised.2. Climate change mainstreamed in district planning and budgeting.3. Climate Change resilient investments (infrastructure and services)4. Monitoring and evaluation for Learning.5. Preparations for national upscale phase (from 2023 and onwards).The proposed programme will be implemented during 2018-2023 in the districts of Massingir, GuijÃ¡, Mabalane och Chicualacuala in the Gaza province (ongoing pilot phase since 2015) with gradual upscaling in these districts and replication in Chigubo, Massangena, ChÃ³kwe and Chibuto districts in Gaza and to the districts of Jangamo, Panda, Funhalouro, Govuro and Mabote in the Inhambane province. The selection of districts has been done on the basis of an analysis of vulnerability to climate change, in consultation with concerned stakeholders. The Embassy of Sweden (herefafter EoS) will sign a financing agreement with the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)(New York Headquarters), with programme management handled from their local representation in Maputo, Mozambique.

By the beginning of 2018, most of the refugees had returned and the majority of the remaining 10800 refugees are not expected to return but possibly stay permanently within the border area communities. The level of education for refugees and local people in the region is low and illiteracy in the area is even lower than the country average 52%. The aim of the project is to contribute towards the fulfilment of right to education and to enhance the resilience of participants and communities. The project provides adult education for both refugees and local residents in Bahn camp and in the refugee hosting communities in Nimba as well as in Liberian communities in Bong. As a result of the training, knowledge and participation will improve and social cohesion of the communities will be strengthened. As the project increases the literacy of the population, it creates a forum for discussion on community development issues and encourage self-initiated development contributing to improved well-being. The project has human rights based approach enabling participation of refugees and community membes to planning and implementation of the activities. Majority of the participants will be women whose participation in decision making and development activities will increase due to improved self-esteem and communication skills. Existing inequalities are reduced by offering equal learning opportunies also to other marginalised groups. With literacy and other skills gained during the project participants capacity to adopt to changing climate will increase. The project beneficiaries are adult learners (Ivorian refugees and Liberians), trained community based facilitators,  community literacy management committee members and their family members.

BBC Media Action,BBC MEDIA ACTION,"Summary: Partly because of the civil war, young people in Sierra Leone have been maligned and marginalized. Attitudes are starting to change because of the active and valued role young people played in the Ebola outbreak. This project will give them a media platform to express themselves and tell their stories of achievement and success. Comic Relief funds will be used to produce a new youth radio show and documentaries made by and for young Sierra Leoneans. As a result of the project, a space will be created for the voices of young people in Sierra Leone to be heard more in the future with broadcasters and politicians increasingly recognizing the legitimacy of that voice. The Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust funded 70 percent of this grant - this share is excluded to avoid double counting in the DAC statistics. Full grant commitment: GBP 255.834 thousand.",Yes,0.920987844467163

Health care provision and nutritional support for internally displaced refugees in Dohuk province,HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT FOR INTERNALLY DISPLACED REFUGEES IN DOHUK PROVINCE,"The project proposal aims to improve health care conditions of internally displaced refugees in Iraq. The aim is to decrease morbidity and mortality of internally displaced refugees. The project is planned to take place in 2 locations â Dawoodia refugee camp (with more than 8,000 inhabitants) and 5 countryside locations in Dohuk Province (Sharya, Sina, Sheladze, Balqosh and Gersheen) as both of them struggle with access to health care, which will be significantly improved after the project implementation. The following results are expected: Result #1: Access to health care services in Dawoodia camp. Thanks to the implementation of the project at least 9,600 refugess will be provided access to health care services in the already existing health center located in the camp. Due to lack of financial resources and lack of personnel the health center could be used only in limited scope. More than 5,000 children (under the age of 5) are expected to be treated during the duration of the project. In addition, at least 800 pregnant women will be provided health care services and 900 children will be enrolled in the vaccination program. Medical doctor will be employed and the health center will be regularly supplied with necessary medical equipment according to the patients'needs Result #2: Access to health care services in Dohuk Province thanks to a mobile health center Currently countryside locations of Sharya, Sina, Sheladze, Balqosh and Gersheen have no access to health care services. The main reason is the lack of proper infrastructure and lack of health care professionals (medical doctors & nurses) as well as proper equipment. As a result of the project implementation a mobile health center will be created and at least 9,600 patients are expected to be treated during the duration of the project and a medical doctor is expected to be hired. Result #3: Improved nutrition for children in Dawoodia camp thanks to a antimalnutrition center There are approximatelz 1,500 children (under 5) in Dawoodia camp who are currently under threat of malnutrition. The project will ensure nutritional screeding for children as well as their subsequent treatment. In order to achieve the planned results the following acitivities are expected to take place: â¢ Selection of medical doctor for a health center in Dawoodia camp â¢ Operation of a health center in Dawoodia camp â¢ Selection of medical doctor for the mobile health center â¢ Operation of a mobile health center â¢ Operation of an anti-malnutrition center in Dawoodia camp Implementation of the project will lead to better health care of internally displaced refugees. As a result, better access to health care services will have positive effect on their migration plans - many of them would be less willing to continue their migration to European countries once they are ensured access to quality health care services.

Improved management of labour mobility and reduction of irregular migration,IMPROVED MANAGEMENT OF LABOUR MOBILITY AND REDUCTION OF IRREGULAR MIGRATION,"This project aims at supporting the implementation of the Ethiopian Government's Jobs Compact, announced in September 2016, which includes nine pledges to support improved access of refugees to labour market, education and integration opportunities. The Jobs Compact arose in the follow-up to the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants, and its annex entitled the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2016. The project builds on ongoing work to implement the CRRF and coordinate efforts to enhance refugee self-reliance in Ethiopia, which has been identified by UNHCR, in consultation with its member States, as one of the pilot countries for this exercise as part of the process in the lead-up to a Global Compact for Refugees. ILO interventions will be framed within the ILO-UNHCR Memorandum of Understanding, as revised on 2016, and the ensuing operational joint plan of action to concretize this institutional partnership. The project will focus on: (1) strengthening ILO strategic positioning in the national refugee response and leveraging new opportunities to support the implementation of the Jobs Compact and the identification of a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, (2) enhancing the capacity of relevant government institutions and of the social partners to support the implementation of the Jobs Compact, (3) identifying the labour market demand requirements as well as potential sectors for job creation, (4) supporting a sustainable supply chain approach, and (5) conducting pilot activities. Interventions will draw on the experience of the ILO's Syrian refugee response in Jordan and Turkey, and will offer opportunities to operationalize the ILO Guiding Principles on the access of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to the labour market, and to apply the Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience, 2017 (No. 205), in particular by supporting the active engagement of ILO tripartite constituents in the implementation of the Jobs Compact. This project contributes to the country's efforts to advance towards the achievement of SDG targets 8.8 (Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrant, and those in precarious employment) and 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe and regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies).",Yes,0.893162190914154

Livelihood Support and Women's Empowerment in Cox's Bazar/Soutien aux moyens de subsistance et renforcement du pouvoir des femmes Ã  Cox's Bazar,LIVELIHOOD SUPPORT AND WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT IN COX'S BAZAR/SOUTIEN AUX MOYENS DE SUBSISTANCE ET RENFORCEMENT DU POUVOIR DES FEMMES Ã COX'S BAZAR,"This project provides comprehensive livelihood support for communities, particularly women, girls and young adolescents, living in the host communities affected by the influx of over 740,000 displaced Rohingya people in  Cox's Bazar since August 2017. Cox's Bazar is one of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable districts, with the poverty rate well above the national average. Even before the influx, 33% of the host community population lived below the poverty line and 17% below the extreme poverty line. The arrival of the refugees has increased the supply of labour in the affected areas, driving down wages and increasing competition in the labour market, with a particular impact on the poorest host community households including those whose primary source of income is day labour. The influx has also put immense pressure on the availability and delivery of essential health services which were already scarce and overstretched. Women and girls, and women-headed households, are particularly vulnerable in this situation, including to gender-based violence which is likely to increase in times of economic stress.The project is designed to meet the immediate needs of the affected host communities in selected sub-districts in Cox's Bazar, while building skills, resilience and awareness to facilitate their long-term well-being. With a focus on empowering and girls, the objective is to lift the most affected host communities out of poverty through a program that combines livelihoods, social safety nets, financial inclusion and social integration. Activities include: providing grants and related support to ultra-poor women for income generation activities such as home gardening and poultry-rearing, , improving household food  consumption, employment-linked apprenticeship training for out-of-school youth and adolescents (male and female), facilitating production and retailing of traditional clothing materials by women artisans, and targeted training of community health workers and midwives to help address the essential health needs of the most vulnerable host communities. The activities are expected to directly benefit over 10,000 women and young adults and reach over 200,000 members of their households. / Ce projet vise Ã  offrir un soutien Ã  la subsistance complet aux personnes, en particulier les femmes, les filles et les adolescents, qui vivent dans les communautÃ©s hÃ´tes de Cox's Bazar touchÃ©es par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 Rohingyas dÃ©placÃ©s depuis aoÃ»t 2017. Cox's Bazar est un des districts les plus pauvres et les plus vulnÃ©rables du Bangladesh, le taux de pauvretÃ© y est beaucoup plus Ã©levÃ© que la moyenne nationale. MÃªme avant l'afflux des Rohingyas, 33 % de la population de ces communautÃ©s vivait sous le seuil de la pauvretÃ©, et 17 %, sous le seuil de l'extrÃªme pauvretÃ©. L'arrivÃ©e des rÃ©fugiÃ©s a fait augmenter l'offre d'emploi dans les rÃ©gions touchÃ©es, entraÃ®nant une baisse des salaires et une augmentation de la concurrence sur le marchÃ© du travail, ce qui a eu des rÃ©percussions graves sur les mÃ©nages les plus pauvres des communautÃ©s hÃ´tes, y compris ceux pour lesquels la principale source de revenus est le travail journalier. L'afflux de rÃ©fugiÃ©s a aussi imposÃ© une pression immense sur la disponibilitÃ© et la prestation des services de santÃ© essentiels, qui se faisaient dÃ©jÃ  rares. Les femmes et les filles ainsi que les mÃ©nages dirigÃ©s par une femme, sont particuliÃ¨rement vulnÃ©rables dans cette situation, notamment Ã  la violence fondÃ©e sur le sexe, qui a tendance Ã  augmenter en pÃ©riode de stress Ã©conomique.Le projet est conÃ§u de maniÃ¨re Ã  combler les besoins immÃ©diats des communautÃ©s hÃ´tes touchÃ©s dans certains sous-districts de Cox's Bazar, tout en renforÃ§ant les compÃ©tences, la rÃ©silience et la sensibilisation nÃ©cessaires Ã  leur bien-Ãªtre Ã  long terme.

F.a: Rights Based Empowerment Project RBEP,F.A: RIGHTS BASED EMPOWERMENT PROJECT RBEP,"1. Project: 11681 Right Based Empowerment Project #2. Project area and Country: Kayin State, Chin State, and Delta Ayarwaddy Region in Myanmar #3. Project justification: #All the villages in the region are vulnerable to and facing multiple hazards and suffer from on-going violence between the state and non-state groups. In Chin, Ayeyarwaddy, Kayin, Rakhine and Magwa, on average 42.2% of the households depend on unimproved sources of drinking water and unhealthy sanitation practices. The local populations suffer from food insecurity and lack of livelihood options. Local villages lack health services and schools that provide children a safe and inclusive learning environment. Local level civic participation is limited in particular by women, children and people with disabilities.  #4. The main objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the Rights Based Empowerment Project is to contribute to the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development in Myanmar. The project will focus on community empowerment and will increase the 130 targeted communities skills and capacity in risk management, while applying environmentally friendly measures. The targeted households will increase their access to sustainable and diversified means of livelihood, primary health care and WASH facilities, while children will access schools with improved learning environments. The project will enhance the local communities ability to claim their rights, encourage their direct participation in the decision-making processes and promote dialogue between the rights holders and duty bearers at all levels. At the end of the project, the right holders will play a more active role in household and village development. #5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 50,000 people in 130 villages (VDCs, Interest groups, Partner Households, Women groups and Youth groups) #Duty bearers: # Township, Village Tract and Village General Administration Authority/Office# Village level health volunteers, school teachers, school PTAs/SMCs# Township level Government line departments like education, health, WASH, livestock, agriculture, irrigation, police, judicial, basic physical infrastructure, and others# Relevant Union and State/Region level Government departments and committees#6.

"Advisers in humanitarian and development related matters at ODIHR in Warsaw, Poland","ADVISERS IN HUMANITARIAN AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED MATTERS AT ODIHR IN WARSAW, POLAND","The roles of the senior political and special advisors to the ODIHR Director are to provide policy advice on the programmes and projects ODIHR is implementing in the OSCE participating States. Those pertain to democracy and human rights, to rule of law, democratic elections, tolerance and non-discrimination. The ODIHR work includes support and training to national human rights institutions, support to human rights defenders and human rights education, monitoring and reporting on fundamental freedoms (such as freedom of assembly) and human rights situation in the OSCE region, programmes on promoting human rights compliance in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, projects on promoting gender and security, national referral mechanisms for victims of trafficking, Rule of Law work focusing on independence of the judiciary, assessment of legislation and its compliance with international standards relating to democracy and human rights, democratic lawmaking, parliamentary oversight, political participation of women, participation of youth, persons with disabilities and Roma and Sinti in public and political life, integration of migrants, observation of elections to assess their compliance with international standards for democratic elections, including participation of minorities, projects to promote tolerance, non-discrimination and freedom of religion or belief, and programmes on reporting on hate-crimes and training on how to effectively counter and prosecute such crimes. ODIHR is mandated to work in all 57 participating States of the OSCE. However, as with other structures and field offices of the organization who work in the human dimension (human rights and democracy) a great majority of all extra-budgetary projects of the ODIHR are focused on states of the former Soviet Union (excluding the Baltic States) and Western-Balkans (excluding Croatia and Slovenia), partially due to restrictions many donor states have to financing projects that are not DAC compatible.  See enclosed list of extra-budgetary programmes. For programmes within the OSCE unified budget, the same applies. As an example, election observation is by far the largest component, comprising over 50% of Over 95% of long- and short-term observers deployed for election observation missions, observed in the countries listed above, as an example, in 2018 ODIHR observed elections in 16 OSCE states (number of observers in brackets): Cyprus (6), Italy (6), Russia (493), Turkmenistan (6), Hungary (19), Azerbaijan (320), Montenegro (127), Slovenia (7), Turkey (384), Sweden (2), North-Macedonia (283), Bosnia and Herzegovina (337), Latvia (6), United States (49), Georgia (392), Armenia (287).",Yes,0.838314831256867

Cox's Bazar is one of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable districts, with poverty well above the country's national average. The influx of Rohingya has increased economic tensions and competition for scarce resources, including jobs and income among the Rohingya and the existing Bangleshi communities where the refugees are camped, as well as having a serious impact on local infrastructure and services. This situation is particularly difficult for women and children who are the most vulnerable.The project works to improve the accessibility to GBV and psychosocial services in public health facilities and women-friendly spaces for survivors of GBV. Project activities include: (1) increasing awareness and use of services by survivors through outreach activities, (2) building the self-reliance skills of 4,000 women with information on their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), functional numeracy and literacy skills, nutrition and core life skills, (3) engaging 30,000 community members through implementing, for the first time in Bangladesh, the SASA! (Start, Awareness, Support, Action) community mobilization strategy for raising awareness and preventing GBV, and (4) developing a community-based GBV response and prevention program, including engagement with men and boys for their role in protecting families and communities from GBV.Benefiting over 500,000 women and girls, the project supports the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in: (1) strengthening public health facilities to provide high-quality midwifery and emergency obstetric care, (2) increasing the availability of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, including family planning, contraception and treatment of STIs and HIV, and (3) developing training materials and providing training for health care providers on GBV response and treatment of survivors. / Le projet vise Ã  fournir des soins de santÃ© sexuelle et reproductive Ã©quitables et Ã  lutter contre la violence basÃ©e sur le genre (VBG) pour les personnes vivant dans les communautÃ©s locales de Cox's Bazar touchÃ©es par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 rÃ©fugiÃ©s rohingyas depuis aoÃ»t 2017.

Climate and nutrition smart villages as platforms to address food insecurity in Myanmar,CLIMATE AND NUTRITION SMART VILLAGES AS PLATFORMS TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY IN MYANMAR,"Myanmar is at risk from a wide range of natural hazards, including cyclones, floods, and droughts. These risks are especially challenging for poor rural women and children, who suffer even more from hunger, food insecurity, and a lack of adequate health services. Since these risks differ across agro-ecosystems in the country, it is crucial that adaptation measures recognize the value of targeted, location-specific, community-based strategies and processes. Community-based adaptation approaches have been tested in the Philippines for the past three years and are currently being mainstreamed via national government processes. This project builds on lessons from these methodological, institutional, and model-building research efforts leveraging the linkages between agriculture, climate change, and nutrition. The goal of this project is to identify and scale optimal climate-smart agriculture practices and interventions suitable for the four major agro-ecological regions of Myanmar: the central dry zone, the mountain uplands, the upland-plateau, and the delta. Using participatory research methods, the study, implemented by the New York City-based International Institute for Rural Reconstruction, will assess a portfolio of low-cost technologies and interventions in selected locations that serve as Climate Smart Villages. Towards the end of the project, scalable models will lead to guidelines for promoting a number of proven approaches that farmers can select for their specific agro-ecological zones.",Yes,0.6687371134758

SimultÃ¡neamente, EspaÃ±a, potencia colonizadora del Sahara Occidental, abandona el Territorio.

F.a: Kishapu Climate Change Adaptation Programme,F.A: KISHAPU CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PROGRAMME,"The Kishapu area is one of the poorest of Tanzania. A challenge is the shortage of potable water. The situation has deteriorated as the local climate becomes drier. Reasons are increased firewood usage due to population increase, and traditional farming methods. This has transformed the area into semi-desert in many places. Chemicals harmful to health have polluted ground water. A new challenge is rainfall unpredictability brought about by climate change, which weakens food security. The project, part of the TCRS village community empowerment program, supports the population in the area in adapting to the change in their habitat and in prevention of desertification. Expected long-term effects: members of village communities within project sphere of influence actively participate in the development of their villages taking into consideration environmental impacts. Results of activities (i) improved status of women and girls, youth, hiv-positive and disbled individuals, (ii) improved availability of clean drinking water, (iii) functioning hygiene and sanitary solutions in schools and homes, (iv)  members of village communities in project villages participate in decision making and development of their communities with regard to environmental impacts, (v) behaviour of households is modified to be more environmentally friendly, (vi) transparent, responsible, and democratic leadership in project villages. The Kishapu project area covers 14 villages, and the education project includes 8Â 313 beneficiaries (3039W, 1671M, 2091G, 1512B, including 213 disabled individuals) and 504 (139W, 365M) bearers of responsibility. Additionaly there are 31Â 613 indirect beneficiaries. The target groups are children and youth in danger of becoming marginalized, disabled people, women, girls, victims of financial, sexual, and physical abuse, civil servants, political decision makers, and key individuals of organizations. The project is implemented by Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS). Their area of expertise includes the problems of refugees and those living in extreme poverty and human rights based approach in village communities. They activate villagers to act as they accumulate knowledge and skills. Administrative competence of the organization is strong, and professional skills of its employees is high.

Sustainable Rural Infrastructure Development Project in Northern Mountain Provinces,SUSTAINABLE RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN NORTHERN MOUNTAIN PROVINCES,"The project will rehabilitate and upgrade deteriorated but critical rural infrastructure in 15 mountainous provinces of northern Viet Nam. These provinces have a combined population of 12.2 million people and are among the poorest in the country. Overall poverty rates average about 27%, but are considerably higher in more isolated areas, where poverty levels may be 50%-60%. One of the main reasons for these high levels of poverty is limited access to productive assets and infrastructure (such as irrigation water systems), and physical isolation. The project will focus on improving small- to medium-scale irrigation and/ordrainage systems, rural roads, and district and commune markets. The project will include 40-45 subprojects. Rehabilitation and upgrading of rural infrastructure is expected to have a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of the population in the project area, providing easier access to inputs (including irrigation water), markets, health services, higher levels of education, and employment opportunities, while reducing production and marketing costs..

Description: This project will better characterise the transmission dynamics of dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, their persistence in the global human population and use the insights gained to refine assessments of the potential impact of interventions. I will develop evidence-synthesis models linking multiple streams of surveillance data to estimate spatiotemporal variations in the reproduction number of Chikungunya and Zika viruses from the recent epidemics in Colombia and Brazil and use age-stratified dengue incidence data to estimate the transmission intensity of dengue. Analyses of geospatial correlation between transmission intensity estimates of the arboviruses will provide insight into transmission similarities and potential immune-mediated interactions. Using advanced inferential techniques, I will characterise climate-dependent entomological and epidemiological parameters, which will be used to produce global dynamic maps of arbovirus transmission intensity. I will then add spatial structure to the dynamical models of arbovirus transmission to explore the extent to which seasonality, immune-mediated interactions, human movement and zoonotic reintroduction determine arbovirus persistence and the feasibility of elimination. Analyses of clinical trial data will provide insights into the immunogenicity, efficacy and mode of action of the Takeda dengue vaccine and inform the targeting and optimisation of vaccination alone and in combination with other interventions in specific locations.",Review,0.485403418540955

Higher temperatures, frequent droughts and increasingly heavy rainfall are aggravating the ongoing food insecurity (76% in 2016/17), poverty (76%), stunting (27%), and degradation of agricultural, forest and pasture ecosystems in the more arid Agro-Ecological Regions (AERs) III, IV and V in particular. Nowhere is this more evident than in the vulnerability hot-spots of Buhera (Manicaland Province), Gutu (Masvingo Province) and Bulilima (Matabeleland Province) districts. Failure to adapt to climate change may cause the rural sector and smallholder farmers to fall further behind in terms of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Climate Adaptation for Rural Livelihoods (CARL) in Zimbabwe project's Theory of Change is premised on the belief that the capacity of rural households to absorb, adapt or transform in the face of increasing climate risk can be improved if there are changes in their access to a combination of livelihood assets at household (micro), watershed (meso) and national (macro) levels. The goal of the CARL project is to improve the well-being of Zimbabwe's rural population and reduce poverty and food insecurity in the face of climate change. The underlying project development objective is to improve the climate resilience of agricultural production and rural livelihoods for 6,000 households in Buhera, Gutu and Bulilima Districts of Zimbabwe. This will be achieved through three interrelated outcomes, (i). Targeted vulnerable communities increase adoption of climate resilient livelihoods and agricultural production systems, (ii). Rural women and youth in targeted vulnerable districts increase their income and economic power in sustainable agriculture value chains, and (iii). Support institutions have strengthened technical capacities to address mitigation and adaptation concerns of rural livelihoods.The CARL project will use Climate Resilient Villages and associated micro-watersheds as entry points to combine the scaling up of existing successful practices with innovations and new pilots in areas where needed. The scaling up will be achieved by leveraging financing from government, farmers, the private sector (including the financial sector) and other development partners that share Oxfam's ambition to reduce rural poverty through increased climate resilience and productivity.BeneficiariesThe project will directly benefit 6,000 households (25,200 women, men, youth and children) from 16 wards in Buhera (6 wards), Gutu (5 wards) and Bulilima (5 wards) districts. Of these, the project will deliberately target 1500 women (500 from each district) and 300 youths (20 from 15 wards. In Bulilima only 4 wards will be targeted since youths there tend to be too mobile) for enterprise development to support some of the resilience building interventions. The",Review,0.34830167889595

The strategy is spearheaded by such urban development schemes as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and its subcomponent the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. Apart from supporting the Government's priority of planned development of urban centers in the country, the Investment Program is also aligned with the objectives of fostering economic growth and reducing poverty in Rajasthan. The fast growing sectors in Rajasthan are mostly in urban areas, where productivity is 3.5 times higher than in rural areas. The emphasis on urban development in Rajasthan, financial reforms and the passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act in 1992, which laid the basis for decentralization in the urban sector, have made some improvements, but large inefficiencies in service delivery, low investment in wider service coverage, and poor maintenance persist.The Investment Program and its road map are guided by the 10th FYP 2002-2007 and 11th FYP 2007-2012 of the Government of India. (See the Framework Financing Agreement for the Investment Program, Schedule 1) The Investment Program links capital investments to reforms for sustainable impact.

Construction of the potable water wells for the town of Bozan,CONSTRUCTION OF THE POTABLE WATER WELLS FOR THE TOWN OF BOZAN,"The project of building four wells in the town of Bozan reflects an acute need to provide a potable water for 1,980 families of the original inhabitants of the town together with another 400 families of IDPs, who escaped from the Sinjar Region because of the armed conflict which started in 2014. Three wells, which already exists in the town were constructed in 1980 and since the town had only a half of its current population, their production was sufficiet. Nowadays the two out of three wells are very old and the third does not function at all. The two functioning well are able to provide potable water at maximum for half of the town's poppulation and their can operate only when there is an elecricity in public grid - which works approx. 6 - 9 hours per day. Becuase of the previous armed conflict, which officialy ended only in December 2017, neither the local government nor the town itself does not have a funds for the (re)construction of the wells. The realization of the project forsee the construction of three new wellls and the reconstruction of one old, which does not function. Two wells will be connected to the already existing water tank which already provide the potable wated to the town water distribution network. Another two wells will be also connected to the new water tank which will be constructed by another project and subsequently it will be connected to the town water distribution grid. The project will therefore exclude the lack of the potable water which in combination with the high temperatures, which in this region of Iraq reach even 50 Â°C, present serious danger for life of local inhabitants and also a high risk for contangious deseases caused by a low hygiene. Moreover the sufficciency of the potable water will support the local inhabitants in the cattle breeding and the agriculture, which will reinforce the cohesion between the local original inhabitants and the IDPs families.",Review,0.284394115209579

Project: 11762 Enhancing livelihoods and access to the labor market opportunities for Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians#2. Project area and Country: Jordan (Amman and Mafraq Governorates) #3. Project justification: #The youth unemployment rate in Jordan is exceptionally high, nearly a third of the Jordanian youth aged 15-24 is out of work, which is double the international average. The problem is particularly severe for young women. In the past few years, the situation has been further complicated by the influx of Syrian refugees who compete especially for unskilled jobs and often have to settle for lower salaries. At the same time, public sector jobs that constitute more than 60 % of formal employment in Jordan, can employ only a limited number of local youth and remain inaccessible to the new-comers. As a result of the multitude of problems, the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living by the Jordanian youth and the Syrian refugee youth remain unmet. Given the limited absorption capacity of the public sector, as well as its inaccessibility to the refugee population, it is now necessary to look into the private sector for effective solutions to address youth unemployment.#4. The main objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the project is the improved socio-economic status and resilience of Syrian refugees in Jordan as well as their host communities. This will be promoted through enhanced market-oriented vocational skills and capacities of the targeted marginalized people including women and PWDs, provision of start-up business opportunities for rights-holders with feasible and innovative project ideas and improved coordination and awareness on enterprise promotion and socio-economic development at national and regional level.#5. Right-holders/ beneficiaries: 400 Syrian and Jordanian youth and young adults in vulnerable life situations #Duty bearers: Jordanian Ministry of Education, local vocational training institutes in Amman and Mafraq#6.

HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis Prevention/PrÃ©vention du VIH/sida et de la tuberculose,HIV/AIDS AND TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTION/PRÃVENTION DU VIH/SIDA ET DE LA TUBERCULOSE,"The project aims to improve the health of people affected by AIDS (particularly children), to lower rates of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) infection, as well as to increase community awareness of HIV/AIDS and TB testing services, prevention, and treatment.At the time of the project launch, a study from the Human Sciences Research Council indicated that the prevalence of HIV in South Africa was at its highest rate in history. In the project target area of Ngqushwa district in the Easter Cape province, HIV prevalence rates fluctuate between 33% and 45% of pregnant women of which only 10% present for voluntary screening.In response, the project provides education and prevention services regarding pediatric AIDS, prevention of mother-to-child transmission and TB, and improves the quality of care and support for people living with AIDS and for TB patients. Pregnant women are encouraged to attend pre- and post-natal care, get screened for TB, be tested for HIV, and receive appropriate care during pregnancy. The project benefits 29,500 HIV- and TB-infected people in Ngqushwa municipality. Project activities are implemented in collaboration with Primate's World Relief and Development Fund's local partner, Keiskamma Trust (KT). / Le projet vise Ã  amÃ©liorer la santÃ© des personnes affectÃ©es par le sida (particuliÃ¨rement les enfants), Ã  rÃ©duire le taux d'infection au VIH/sida et Ã  la tuberculose, et Ã  augmenter la sensibilisation des communautÃ©s vis-Ã -vis les services de prÃ©vention et de traitement.Au moment du lancement du projet, une Ã©tude du Human Sciences Research Council indiquait que la prÃ©valence du VIH en Afrique du Sud en Ã©tait Ã  son taux le plus Ã©levÃ©. Dans la rÃ©gion visÃ©e par le projet, soit le district de Ngqushwa de la province du Cap-Oriental, les taux de prÃ©valence du VIH fluctuent entre 33 % et 45 % chez les femmes enceintes, dont seulement 10 % ont participÃ© volontairement au dÃ©pistage.En rÃ©ponse, le projet offre des services d'Ã©ducation et de prÃ©vention du sida chez les enfants et de prÃ©vention de la transmission du VIH de la mÃ¨re Ã  son enfant. Il offre Ã©galement des services de prÃ©vention de la tuberculose et amÃ©liore la qualitÃ© des soins et l'appui aux personnes vivant avec le sida et aux patients de la tuberculose. Les femmes enceintes sont encouragÃ©es Ã  se prÃ©valoir des soins prÃ© et post nataux, Ã  Ãªtre testÃ©es pour le VIH, et Ã  recevoir des soins appropriÃ©s durant la grossesse. Le projet profite Ã  29 500 personnes infectÃ©s par le VIH/sida ou atteint de tuberculose dans la municipalitÃ© de Ngqushwa.

Improving food policies and enabling healthier diets for preventing non-communicable diseases in the West Bank,IMPROVING FOOD POLICIES AND ENABLING HEALTHIER DIETS FOR PREVENTING NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN THE WEST BANK,"Low fruit and vegetable consumption is tied to poor health and higher risks of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). A survey carried out in 2010-2011 in the West Bank and Gaza revealed consumption patterns significantly below WHO's recommended values, with more than 85% of the population between 15-65 years of age consuming less than five servings of fruits and/or vegetables per day. Several factors contribute to this dietary deficiency, including availability, affordability, lack of awareness of nutritional quality and health benefits, as well as outdated agriculture and food policies. This project, implemented in collaboration with Birzeit University, will explore these factors and recommend effective interventions for increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables in different population groups. Research sites include urban and peri-urban populations of Ramallah and refugee camp populations in al-Bireh governorate. Key dimensions that shape local food environments in these settings will be assessed together with associated dietary patterns, including existing policies related to fruits and vegetables across different sectors (e.g. agriculture, trade, environment, health, education) to identify obstacles and barriers that hinder adequate dietary consumption, awareness in different population groups about associated health benefits and risks (nutritional and food quality aspects), availability, affordability, acceptability, and consumption patterns of both healthy fresh foods and unhealthy food commodities, household food waste and food losses throughout the local fruit and vegetable food chains, and a first estimation of average costs of a healthy diet and a healthy basket for the different study communities. A gender equity lens will be used in exploring challenges and potential benefits faced by women in overcoming existing barriers to healthier dietary improvements in households and communities. The research will generate a first body of local knowledge and evidence across different food environments of the West Bank. It will guide decision-makers, academics, farmers, and other key stakeholders in identifying and formulating policy interventions that increase availability and consumption of fruits and vegetables, along with clear recommendations to promote home and small-scale production.",Review,0.187506884336472

F.a: Empowerment of refugees with adult education,F.A: EMPOWERMENT OF REFUGEES WITH ADULT EDUCATION,"Ethiopia is a significant country of destination and transit for refugees, asylum seekers and others persons of concern fleeing persecutions and insecurity in their country of origin. Ethiopia, with Uganda, is hosting the largest number of registered refugee population in Africa. The project will target both South Sudanese refugees and host communities living in the areas surrounding the camps. South Sudanese refugees have been placed in Gambella Region, located in the South West of the country and bordering South Sudan, against a local population totalling some 310,000 people, of whom approximately 45% are Nuer and 22% Anuak, Gambella hosts more than 350,000 South Sudanese refugees, most of them Nuer, placed in 7 camps. Literacy level is exceptionally low among the South Sudanese, the average literacy rate being 27% (female literacy rate is 16%, and male 40%). This is reflected in UNHCR data from the camps in Gambella, according to which more than 70% of the whole South Sudanese refugee population is uneducated. Similarly, illiteracy is very high also among the local population in Gambela, reaching 54% in the population of 15  60 year olds (40% among males and 66% females). Since the majority of the population in Gambella is Nuer as South Sudanese refugees, FRC intervention on functional literacy will target equally refugees and host communities. The objective of the project is that through an inclusive approach, refugees and host communities in Ethiopia have enhanced their capacity to anticipate, manage, and recover from shocks (resilience) and their mutual relationship (social cohesion) has improved. The outcome of the project is that adult South Sudanese refugees in camps and host communities living nearby are empowered by the acquisition of functional literacy and life skills.

While the extension takes the form of a no-cost extension to allow existing donors not yet ready to commit new funds to remain engaged, the intention is also to enable CIWA to raise funds to reach its initially set target of USD 200 million. The Fund's current total value is  USD 93 million, 35 308 689 of which (or 284 million SEK) have been contributed by Sweden since 2012. Sweden has support the fund since its inception in 2012 and one decsion on contribution and two decisions to add funds have been taken.  Other donors include the Netherlands, the UK, The EU, Denmark and Norway. To date, almost all funds paid into CIWA have been allocated to pipeline, hence planning of new activities will depend on new resources coming in to the fund. The Netherlands recently announced that it will be appraising an additional contribution of USD 20 million in the latter half of 2018 and the WB is also fund-raising with new donors.The current agreement amendment will increase Sida's support to CIWA with another 100 MSEK to a total of 384 MSEK and extend the support to 2026. The funding is channeled through a World Bank Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), of which 75% is recipient executed and 25% is executed by the World Bank, but according to the Trust Fund Assurance Framework 3013 all funds must be programmed according to World Bank guidelines.CIWA was established for a 10-year period (2011-21). An independent mid-term review of the program in 2015 found that CIWA's objectives remained highly relevant, its basic operational approach was sound, and made several specific recommendations to strengthen the program, which are now largely implemented. Sweden has supported CIWA since 2012, and has over the years seen the program deliver good results. The program seems to be on target or over performing against most of its intermediate level indicators. It has a good fit with the Swedish Strategy for SSA, and Sida is therefore interested in CIWA's possibility to continue and expand operation. CIWA's objective is to strengthen cooperative water resources management and development to enable sustainable, climate resilient economic growth in Africa. CIWA helps countries take advantage of opportunities as it advances investments in basin-wide information systems, in institutions for cooperation and coordination or in infrastructure with transboundary impact that can store surplus waters, protect against floods, generate hydropower, promote food security, and enhance resilience in the face of climate change. CIWA also assist riparian States to manage risk as it promotes countries' awareness of their interdependencies and helps them strike a better balance in their decision-making between sovereign and collective considerations. This is becoming increasingly important as communities across Africa increasingly compete for scarce fresh water r",Review,0.178117424249649

The refugee situation in Kenya is protracted with more than 90% of refugees having lived all their lives in camps. The refugee status is not a permanent solution for refugees. Durable solutions - as globally understood - comprise of local integration in the host country, voluntary repatriation in the country of origin or resettlement to a third state. The number of Somali refugees being repatriated is significantly low, largely due to the pervasive insecurity in Somalia. Moreover, there are dwindling resettlement opportunities because many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept refugees for political reasons. One of the main avenues in which refugees can access local integration is through naturalization and/or acquisition of work permits. However, due to unfavorable policies which are related to the government linking refugee hosting to terrorism incidents and the general insecurity in Kenya as well as the pervasive hurdles for naturalization and access to work permits, the prospect of actualizing durable solutions through local integration in Kenya remains diminished. The linkage of hosting refugees to insecurity has led to xenophobic attitudes within the Kenyan society towards refugees and a range of abuses meted on refugees by security agents, including arbitrary arrests, extortion, torture and deportation.",Review,0.159798145294189

Many countries show trends towards globalization of migration, that is, more countries are affected more profoundly by significant flows of migration to and from an increasing variety of destinations and origins. African migration is to a great extent intra-continental even if there has been an acceleration and spatial diversification of emigration out of Africa since the late 1980's. African migration is often seen as being essentially driven by poverty, violent conflicts and underdevelopment, increasing migration seems rather to be driven by processes of development and social transformation, which have increased the capability and aspirations to migrate, a trend which is likely to continue.The international community is increasingly acknowledging that migrants can make a positive contribution to development, both in countries of origin and destination. Migration has postive effects on poverty reduction via remittances that contribute to savings, investment, the well-being of persons, improved resilience, and the creation of jobs and services. Immigrants have much to contribute to to development although there are factors such as poor integration and underemployment that could undermine their contribution. Data on immigrants could help to create policies that maximize the contribution of migrants to development.The implementation of standardized approaches to collect, process and utilize labour migration relevant data is therefore a priority of this project. In that regard, the project will support the respective African Union Commission (AUC), REC Commissions and member states to promote harmonised methodologies for labour migration data, including supporting the appropriation and use by member states of international standards, methodologies and compatible operating procedures for migration data collection and analysis. On the basis of improving national data sets the project also foresees the compilation of regional data sets providing overviews of labour migration and employment data and trends in the respective REC sub-regions. Use of several forms of data sets is anticipated to strengthen data collection on labour migration. These include field studies using multi-site areas, special studies, administration record systems, national census, population and household surveys, and longitudinal surveys.Hence, this contribution is aiming at supporting Statistics Sweden to achive the following:- To improve the availability of data and analysis on migration and labour statistics at the RECs and improve institutional capacity where the capacity is low,- To enable RECs to harmonize and  incorporate migration, remittances and related issues into the standard households surveys at the member states level,- To enable the RECs to regularly avail the data and analysis on migration, remittances from migrants and the refugee situation in the regions and enable member st",Review,0.126807734370232

WLP's mission is to transform power relations and promote justice, equality, peace, and sustainable development by strengthening the feminist movement. This is done through curriculum and resource development, training, capacity development, advocacy and movement building while promoting and sustaining leadership that is participatory and replicable. WLP's overall objective is to empower women to become active citizens and effective participatory leaders and to build communities of shared values of social and political change to achieve legal equality, economic justice, security and political participation through advocacy and movement building. Sida has funded WLP with core support from 2015. Through curriculum development, training, civil society strengthening, women's human rights advocacy and movement building, WLP has expanded partners' international, regional, and local leadership, raised public awareness on democracy and women's rights, strengthened democratic development and political participation by training more than 22,000 emerging leaders, and achieved commendable results through partners' advocacy and activism. WLP submitted an application to Sida for core support of 36 000 000 SEK for a four-year time-frame (2018-2022) on 27 March, 2018. The intervention will focus on capacity development of its partners, women and girls through training programs, produce and promote feminist research from the Global South, participate in and support women's organisations' advocacy and networking activities, preserve women's movement history though documentation of the women's movement, and expand WLP's international outreach for long-term sustainability.

Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project,URBAN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERY PROJECT,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) is one of the largest public-private partnerships (PPP) in the delivery of primary health care (PHC) in South Asia. The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005.  The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012.  A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II.  With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states).  Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.  According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.  Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor are as worse as those of the rural poor because of poorer living conditions, and limited urban PHC. Failure to provide urban PHC can have serious negative externalities - spread of communicable diseases, debilitating epidemics, reduction in economic productivity, among others..

"Strengthening support mechanisms to migrant population in Morocco, under a gender and human rights approach.","STRENGTHENING SUPPORT MECHANISMS TO MIGRANT POPULATION IN MOROCCO, UNDER A GENDER AND HUMAN RIGHTS APPROACH.","La intervenciÃ³n que proponemos se enmarca dentro del contexto migratorio del Reino de Marruecos. Desde la dÃ©cada de los 90 este paÃ­s ha pasado de ser emisor de migrantes y estar en zona de trÃ¡nsito a convertirse en receptor, sin embargo este fenÃ³meno nunca se habÃ­a traducido en un flujo migratorio clandestino de la magnitud que se aprecia en el dÃ­a de hoy. Las polÃ­ticas migratorias de la UniÃ³n Europea y particularmente de EspaÃ±a han convertido a Marruecos en el gendarme de la frontera del sur de Europa. Esta externalizaciÃ³n de fronteras ha generado un endurecimiento de las polÃ­ticas alauÃ­s que se traduce en una mayor represiÃ³n y control hacÃ­a los migrantes y particularmente la poblaciÃ³n subsahariana establecidos en toda la zona norte, especÃ­ficamente en los alrededores de las ciudades autÃ³nomas de Melilla y Ceuta. La integraciÃ³n de la poblaciÃ³n migrante dentro de la sociedad marroquÃ­ se ha visto dificultada a consecuencia de las dinÃ¡micas sociales que generan recelo, la percepciÃ³n mediÃ¡tica, el comportamiento racista de una parte de la poblaciÃ³n y la dureza de las fuerzas del orden pÃºblico y de seguridad policial-militar que ha extremado la situaciÃ³n de vulnerabilidad del migrante subsahariano/a.  A partir de esto nos propusimos realizar un diagnÃ³stico para identificar la situaciÃ³n y las principales necesidades de la poblaciÃ³n migrante subsahariana. Para llevar a cabo este estudio nos basamos en datos recogidos a travÃ©s de entrevistas abiertas realizadas en el terreno a los propios migrantes, organizaciones e instituciones. La muestra escogida de los principales actores fue un total  de 18 personas, 13 hombres y 5 mujeres, en un rango de edades comprendido entre los 20 y 54, provenientes de 7 paÃ­ses del sur de Ãfrica, de los cuales la mayorÃ­a son cameruneses y costamarfileÃ±os. Con esta informaciÃ³n logramos detectar que necesidades bÃ¡sicas como el alimento, agua, salud e higiene no estÃ¡n al alcance de la mayorÃ­a. Es por esto que nos planteamos trabajar el siguiente objetivo:-Mejorar las condiciones de vida de la poblaciÃ³n migrante subsahariana, mediante la puesta en marcha de una red de asistencia en la regiÃ³n de TÃ¡nger-TetuÃ¡n. Para la consecuciÃ³n de este objetivo nos proponemos trabajar junto a la contraparte local en la adecuaciÃ³n de un centro en la regiÃ³n de Larache que asista en los siguientes Ã¡mbitos: sanitario y salud reproductiva, jurÃ­dico, alimenticio y otras necesidades bÃ¡sicas como la higiene, vestimenta y el acceso a nuevas tecnologÃ­as. Es importante realizar al mismo tiempo un trabajo de sensibilizaciÃ³n en la poblaciÃ³n marroquÃ­ y contribuir con la promociÃ³n de los Derechos Humanos para lo cual proponemos formaciones y sesiones informativas que permitan aumentar el conocimiento de los beneficiarios y beneficiarias. Desarrollando estas lÃ­neas de trabajo esperamos reducir el impacto negativo que provoca la falta de acceso a las necesidades anteriormente mencionadas y otorgar herramientas a los beneficiarios y beneficiarias para conocer su",Yes,0.0368518158793449

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 24,000 children (12,240 girls and 11,760 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 80 school facilities (60 formal public schools and 20 daraas or Koranic schools), as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education).

EMR also receives support (project-, and core support) from a number of other donors. No forwarding of funds will take place with the support Sida contributes.EMR is a network of around 70 members consisting of civil society organizations from Europe and from the countries along the Mediterranean in the Middle East and North Africa, which work for democracy and human rights.EMR's work aims at influencing decision-makers in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in a positive direction regarding human rights and democracy. The work is specifically aimed at trying to influence EU institutions and ensuring that EU relations with the region are based on a human rights perspective.To achieve this, EMR is working to engage selected organizations in Europe and the Middle East that work with democracy and human rights, in regional and national networks, to create alliances and implement joint initiatives (for example campaigns) and exchange experiences on key issues which are relevant to the region.EMR supports selected organizations in their advocacy work towards the EU but also towards the UN and decision makers in Europe and the Middle East and North Africa. EMR works with, and builds the capacity of the organizations on networking, advocacy, monitoring and documentation of key issues regarding democracy and human rights.EMR members have jointly come up with thematic issues where there is a special added value with a regional approach and working methods. EMR has subsequently set up the working groups, Migrants and refugees' rights, Women's rights and gender equality, as well as a group on Economic and social rights. EMR also works through national working groups / solidarity groups where focus is on issues and processes in the specific country. Country-specific groups include Palestine, Tunisia, Syria, Algeria, Morocco and Turkey.The shrinking space for civil society in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region has become an increasingly important factor affecting the various thematic and national rights and democracy issues that EMR is working on. To protect and promote the opportunities for civil society work, promoting freedom of association and assembly will therefore be integrated into the work of the different working groups and in EMR's work overall but also within the regional civil society hub that EMR is establishing with other civil society networks.EMR's added value and strength are the experiences and knowledge available within the network, which is used to cross-fertilise and strengthen work at national-, and regional level.Sida has supported EMR since 2003 and since 2010 with core support.

It reflects the main objective of the call, which is support of Ukraine in building functioning democratic state and improving the living conditions of its inhabitants. Ukrainian society has to cope with social conflicts that are result of reforms, as well as of the war in the East. Most of these conflicts are displayed on the level of municipalities, communities, and families. There are conflicts of national identity and future of the country, sometimes defined as conflicts East-West, conflicts between IDPs and the majority caused by lack of resources and missing integration program,conflicts between war combatants and their communities and families,conflicts related to economic reforms and resulting poverty and exclusion of some groups. These conflicts are hard to be solved in the national level. The government does not have capacities to do so. It is more effective and realistic to cope with them on the local level through participatory planning of community development. The project is relying on the network of community activists having years of successful work behind themselves and so the got trust of their fellow citizens.They will be bearers of changes together with representatives of local governments. We will focus on 3 cities (200-700 000 inhabitants) having potential to become good examples for others. The project contains: capacity building through trainings and consultations, financial support of common plans of the city development and small projects on conflict resolution, transfer of experience from Slovakia through internships and festivals of community activities.",Review,0.0159977097064257

Public-Private-People: Joint and Inclusive Effort Against Tuberculosis in Somalia,PUBLIC-PRIVATE-PEOPLE: JOINT AND INCLUSIVE EFFORT AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS IN SOMALIA,The project builds on the previous TB intervention implemented by LSV. However in order to increase effectiveness totally new strategies will be applied.TB continues to be an essential health problem in Somalia. The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rather new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the private sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration with the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and participation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB culture services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to TB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs). When it comes to climate proofing there are no negative impacts on environment. For example thanks to community DOTS there will be less daily traveling to TB Centers.The main project partners include NGO called PSR and National TB Programs (NTPs). LSV will strengthen their capacity in all the fields described above.The main beneficiaries include local people of Hargeisa Mogadishu and nomads living in nearby areas who have TB or belong to risk groups. The project will help the poorest of the poor. For example many cases are found among people who suffer from malnutrition.,Review,0.0087580131366849

The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisoners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Somaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia.

The increase of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global threat  fighting against MDR-TB in Somalia benefits all countries. Another central problem is the low treatment coverage rate of about 37% leaving far too many cases untreated further transmitting tuberculosis to others. The impact targets of the project are to: a) tackle multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and b) increase the tuberculosis case detection rate. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to the reduction of the tuberculosis burden in Somalia with the following means:1. Increase the access of women and vulnerable groups to TB services (such as disabled personsIDPs and prisoners)2. Increase TB referrals from the private sector3. Improve the quality of TB treatment in both the public and private sector4. Improve the quality of TB laboratory work.The central partners of the project are the National Tuberculosis Programmes of Somaliland and Somalia. PSR has a central role in developing the national tuberculosis diagnostic infrastructure in Somalia. The project will support the National TB Reference Laboratories in Somaliland and South-Central Somalia as well as will treatment of tuberculosis patients in 3 clinics in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. These clinics will develop innovative community public and private sector engagement models to increase case detection improve treatment quality and to increase public awareness and decrease stigma/discrimination. The clinics will also provide HIV services and nutritional support for malnourished patients (with WFP).Together with the local administration the tuberculosis clinics will be transformed into health centers providing specialized tuberculosis services by the end of 2022 to support integration with basic health services and sustainability after the project has ended.",Review,0.00806998834013939

Learning from lessons learned from the 1997/98 Asian Financial Crisis (AFC) and the 2008/09 global financial crisis, the Government has introduced a number measures to safeguard against any major trade and financial impacts emanating from the current global economic situation. The proposed $500 million INO-PFF (a countercyclical support facility with a precautionary financing option) will enhance the Government s preparedness to address the potential adverse impact of increased volatility in the financial market, given the government s increased dependence on the market to meet its budget financing needs.  The Government has met the access criteria under ADB s guidelines for a countercyclical support facility: (i) continued good macroeconomic management, (ii) potentially significant economic impact (resulting, in this case, from a possible worsening in the eurozone crisis), and (iii) implementation of a countercyclical program in the revised 2012 budget.",Review,0.00728900544345379

Support in Development of Waste Water Management in the Moldovan Centre Region - Better Waste Water Management Step by Step,SUPPORT IN DEVELOPMENT OF WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT IN THE MOLDOVAN CENTRE REGION - BETTER WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT STEP BY STEP,"Low accessibility of the sewerage system is a long-standing problem in Moldova. The project proposal focuses on the Central region of the the Republic of Moldova and the town of Straseni. Only 15% of the population has access to the sewerage system (the national average is 30%). In Straseni (about 22 thousand inhabitants) access to the sewerage system is secured for only 61% of the population, which is little in the urban area. The town also does not have a waste water treatment plant. A poorly developed sewerage system is one of the factors that create unfavourable sanitation conditions and cause more frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases, and it is also a barrier to further socio-economic development. The project aims to support the development of waste water management in the Central region. The support will be built on three interconnected pillars: (1) support to the extension of infrastructure - the construction of a sewerage connection in the town of Straseni (2,640 m of newly built sewerage serving 1080 inhabitants/308 households), and the elaboration of a Feasibility Study and an Environmental Impact Assessment for the missing waste water treatment plant in Straseni, (2) capacity building of 12 urban water management operators (municipal enterprises) and 13 municipal authorities of the Central Region through the implementation of two expert workshops and two study vistis in Slovakia, (3) engagement of the public in the Central region and raising awareness about responsible approach to environment with emphasis on the proper management of household waste water. Education of the community will be delivered in form of an educational summer camp for 20 young people who, in addition to acquiring knowledge, will develop their own local community water management projects, and present their community.

SAIIA has a newly developed research framework for 2017-2021 with six research pillar and the planned Swedish support will have a soft earmarking for the areas of climate change, natural resource management, democracy and human rights.Given the broad span of SAIIA's research activities, the institution's work has relevance for all results areas in Sweden's regional development cooperation strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa, but, as mentioned above, a decision has been taken to provide the funding envelope with a soft earmarking and following results should be underlined:â¢Strengthened capacity of regional actors to work towards sustainable management and use of common ecosystem services and natural resourcesâ¢Strengthened capacity of regional actors to work towards increased resilience against climate change and natural disasters, including capacity for food securityâ¢Enhanced capacity of regional actors to work towards strengthened democracy and the rule of law, gender equality and increased respect for human rights, with a focus on the rights of women and childrenAs an evidence-based research institute with pragmatic focus (i.e. asking what makes polices work to produce life-improving outcomes? rather than what is the best policy?), SAIIA has a well-developed intervention logic illustrating how to achieve traction for their research by engaging with decision makers and policy champions, both at national, regional and continental level.

Portfolio guarantee renewable energy Rwanda,PORTFOLIO GUARANTEE RENEWABLE ENERGY RWANDA,"The proposed intervention is a guarantee aimed at facilitating increased access to finance for small and medium sized private actors focused on renewable energy solutions, and end users, to support the development of, and access to, affordable and clean energy solutions in Rwanda in the areas not covered by the national Energy Access Roll-Out Programme (EARP) for grid expansion. In relation to the strategy for Sweden's development cooperation with Rwanda 2015-2019, this is directly linked to increased access to services and support for improved opportunities to start and run commercial businesses, which is one of the result under the support area of better opportunities and tools to enable poor people to improve their living conditions. The intervention strengthens the possibilities for access to capital specifically in the field of renewable energy, which also ties to the support area of a better environment, limited climate change impact and greater resilience to environmental impact, climate change and natural disasters. It is explicitly stated in the strategy that the business sector's work on green economic development and green innovations, including sustainable energy solutions and trade in green products and services, can help to limit negative environmental and climate impacts. This intervention will increase the likelihood of a private sector investment focusing on sustainable energy solutions and green services and therefore be well aligned with the Swedish government strategy in this results area.A guarantee program in Rwanda addressing this sector would also enhance and support the development impact of ongoing and planned initiatives within the Swedish development cooperation with Rwanda. Primarily, the Energy for Impact (E4I) programme, aimed at scaling up renewable energy by supporting the private sector to deliver access to energy in rural areas, will be supported by this guarantee. Supporting the development of increased access to finance for clean energy is also a crosscutting enabler for sustainable economic development, human health, equitable growth and the resilience of poor and vulnerable communities. The guarantee is also relevant in relation to Sweden's current support to Access to Finance Rwanda (AFR) aiming to increase income and productive employment for the poor through increased access, and utilisation, of financial services. The intervention can therefor be viewed as strategic and catalytic for several results areas identified for the Swedish development cooperation with Rwanda. The guarantee is expected to enable financing to private actors focused on development of, and access to, renewable energy solutions. This through risk sharing with the financial institutions, which traditionally are cautious with lending to actors in the energy sector - a sector which is percieved as high risk.

It is hoped that this will build resilience on the part of customary authorities to withstand recurrent crises and efforts by some politicians to instrumentalise them for their war efforts. It is also hoped that this will contribute to the empowerment of a broader civil society coalition for change in South Sudan to counter-act the increasingly repressive military-political regime. The project is intended to conclude with a fourth and final phase in 2018.",Review,0.00366804143413901

Improved disease control by community participation - the case of African swine fever in northern Uganda,IMPROVED DISEASE CONTROL BY COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION - THE CASE OF AFRICAN SWINE FEVER IN NORTHERN UGANDA,"Outbreaks of infectious diseases can act as shocks to the livelihoods of poor people in the same way as other types of catastrophes. By controlling animal diseases, negative impact on economic development, food security and livelihoods can be mitigated. For many important animal diseases the epidemiology is well understood, but despite that, effective control is not achieved. It is becoming evident that to control diseases, sociocultural, economic and political dimensions are as important as veterinary knowledge.African swine fever (ASF), is a severe and fatal infectious disease of pigs, with great socio-economic impact on rural communities in Uganda. ASF has been known and studied for almost 100 years, but is still uncontrolled in most areas.Using multidisciplinary participatory methods, the project will investigate reasons for farmers' responses to disease, such as social pressures, poverty-related constraints, and lack of health and veterinary infrastructure. The feasibility of sustainable implementation of control interventions at all levels in the value chain will be investigated, and the effect of stakeholder participation on the processes evaluated. The project seeks to enable more effective policies for disease control, including promotion of Â control interventions that are feasible to implementÂ  within the particular local context. The results will be applicable to ASF in Uganda and other infectious animal and human diseases in similar settings.",Review,0.00354327447712421

Improving the Integration of Young African Researchers into Research and Innovation Systems,IMPROVING THE INTEGRATION OF YOUNG AFRICAN RESEARCHERS INTO RESEARCH AND INNOVATION SYSTEMS,"The economic crises experienced by African countries since the end of the 1970s, as well as the ensuing structural adjustment programs, have relegated scientific research and technological innovation to the bottom of the list of national and continental priorities. The freeze on recruitment in many research institutions and universities has resulted in an aging cohort of teaching and research personnel. Many young researchers work in the precarious situation of teaching assistants or temporary replacements, without the necessary scientific sponsorship to allow them to evolve in their careers. Against their will, many abandon the domain of research and innovation. If nothing is done during the next 10 years, these public institutions will find themselves in a difficult situation when current staff retire. This project will support an in-depth study in three countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, SÃ©nÃ©gal) in order to explore opportunities available to young researchers in private institutions and research centres, intellectual property services, norms and standards services, nongovernmental organizations and thinktanks. Contracts with associations and entrepreneurs will allow them to define their needs and propose ways of inserting young researchers into the business world.

Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Deep Sequenced Pneumococcal Data,STATISTICAL METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF DEEP SEQUENCED PNEUMOCOCCAL DATA,"Programme: PhD Studentship (Basic). Description: Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is a major disease causing pathogen and can cause sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia especially in at risk populations such as young children and the elderly. Understanding genetic factors in disease virulence, transmissibility, and drug resistance informs the management and treatment of infectious disease. By using deep sequenced patient samples of S. pneumoniae it is possible to build a clearer picture of its within host diversity. I aim to develop statistical and computational methods for the analysis of deep sequenced pathogen data that are also able to deal with large datasets, of the order of thousands of samples. I aim to apply these methods to the analysis of deep sequencing data derived from nearly 4000 S. pneumoniae samples taken from patients in the Maela refugee camp, Thailand. The methods I develop will help to identify significant genetic factors for disease dynamics and antimicrobial resistance. The project will contribute to the understanding of S. pneumoniae and will also provide tools of more general applicability to the investigation of deep sequenced pathogen data. .

Co-constructing a Sustainable Fisheries Future through TURF. A comparison between Viet Nam and Chile,CO-CONSTRUCTING A SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES FUTURE THROUGH TURF. A COMPARISON BETWEEN VIET NAM AND CHILE,"Despite small-scale fisheries (SSF) contributing two-thirds of global catches for human consumption, they have been increasingly marginalized and dispossessed by large-scale fisheries (LSF), a phenomenon labeled, 'the global ocean grab'. This affects fishing communities, leading to resource scarcities, deprivation of livelihoods and environmental degradation. As a solution to confront these crises, Viet Nam and Chile have embarked on introducing territorial use right for fisheries (TURF). TURF are collective action institutions with common management, harvest and income. We aim to compare TURF adoption in both countries, examining their pathways to re-construct towards a sustainable fisheries future. Despite the different material conditions and poverty rankings of Viet Nam and Chile, their SSF belong to coastal vulnerable communities. Both countries offer an array of transformational dimensions to analyze how global and regional forces interact regarding SSF. We will work with coastal communities entitled with TURF, aiming to co-develop action plans to improve the functioning of TURF governance and enhance their access rights and benefits toward a sustainable redistribution of resources. Strengthening TURF access rights will enhance coastal livelihoods and development, and support coastal conservation.

IMF Financial Sector Stability Fund,IMF FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY FUND,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Sector Stability Fund is a Fund for capacity-building in financial stability, integration and advancement in low-and middle-income countries.  Financial inclusion and financial stability are two closely interrelated concepts that both links to the financing for development agenda and the SDG targets. The G-20 has also highlighted the importance of both financial inclusion (Maya Declaration and the global partnership for financial integration) and the strengthening of financial stability (Council for financial stability (Financial Stability Board)), Basel III implementation and other regulatory reforms). At the global level, Sida supports a number of programmes that focus on financial integration but only a few focus on financial stability. Toronto Center and Sida's technical assistance programs with Sweden's Riksbank are two examples. Both of these two have an emphasis on capacity-building of government institutions of all central banks and its features.The IMF's Fund differs from these in that the capacity building the Fund is carrying out has direct links with the IMF's two other main mandates of surveillance and lending and is based on a holistic approach throughout the financial sector. FSSF's connection to the IMF's entirety creates an added value, of course, that there is a direct link to the management of financial crises and resistance to reduce the occurrence of crises, mitigate the impact of these.   The program is based on two main modules: -Module for financial sector statistics that help to provide decision makers with the statistical basis for the analysis of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial sector as well as the interconnection between sectors of the economy and the rest of the world.  -Module for financial sector reforms that will establish diagnostic baseline revisions, highlighting key weaknesses in the financial systems and institutional capacity as well as establish a prioritized action plan for financial sector reforms.       Similar to all IMF capacity development programs, the program is demand-driven, implemented by experienced internal experts and based on the IMF's long history of global commitment in this area. Genuine ownership is a prerequisite to be effective and achieve long-term sustainable results. The close connection to the IMF's surveillance and lending mandates also creates a unique opportunity for long-term sustainable results.",Review,0.00197750865481794
Media Literacy for Sustainable Society,MEDIA LITERACY FOR SUSTAINABLE SOCIETY,This project is a continuation phase for the project Civic Skills via Media Education in Palestine funded by the MFA in 20152016. It offered media education workshops for non-governmental workers professional journalists and municipality workers. The continuation project extend media literacy education to citizens. Project aims to empower young adults in Palestine to actively constructively and peacefully participate in building the society and democracy. Media the Fourth Estate of any functioning democracy ideally provides the citizens sufficient timely and accurate news information and versatile views for the citizens to make informed decisions in both the private and public spheres of their lives. As such properly functioning independent media builds democracy and sustainable society.Project is implemented by creating curriculum for media literacy education training Palestinian media students and professionals and teachers to act media literacy trainers organizing media literacy courses in different parts of Palestine and creating open-access learning material in Arabic and English. The target groups are unprivileged Palestinian young adults people living at the refugee camps C-areas and Gaza. The project targets especially people living in these areas since they have less opportunities for education and are more easily influenced by extreme group lobbying. The project focuses in targeting women because they are a marginalized group in Palestine facing more unemployment and discrimination. Courses offers training in media literacy media ethics and media production skills and offering local young adults work opportunities and international contacts. As it strengthens the target groups media literacy skills the project also prevents radicalization and violent extremism. The project personnel the trainers and course participants will produce journalistic content to be published in media channels in Finland Palestine or internationally as well as in social media. This will help to create a more balanced and fact-based views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for media audiences.,Review,0.00189893809147179

F.a: Sustainabilize South African wine supply chain,F.A: SUSTAINABILIZE SOUTH AFRICAN WINE SUPPLY CHAIN,"This project aims to make South African wine sector more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. The project improves capacity of workers' representatives to support mature systems of industrial relations on grape farms. The project will promote effective social dialogue among stakeholders who play key roles in influencing working conditions in the wine sector in South Africa. This is a joint-project with SASK. South African wine sector is suffering of fragmented trade unions, weak position of seasonal workers, companies' unwillingness to commit to decent work and small share of environmentally sustainable production. Common practice is to exploit labour from undocumented workers from Zimbabwe and Lesotho, who receive lower wages significantly violating minimum wage. This has also caused a lot of fighting and xenophobia, like tendencies among locals who are against employment of migrant workers.  There is gross violation of occupational health and safety issues: exposure of farm workers to pesticides and lack of training on handling chemicals. Alcohol abuse and alcoholism are common due to dop system adopted during the apartheid era, where alcohol was used as a form of payment to farm workers. The project works collaboratively, with value chain dialogue, to develop a strategy aimed at improving wages and closing the Living Wage gap, and to get healthy, motivated productive workforce for the sector. The project also seeks to increase organic wine production and reduce alcohol-related harm. The project will address sexual harassment and gender discrimination, as well as occupational health and safety hazards. The goal of the project is to improve workers' right to decent work in South Africa. The project's purpose is the improved status of workers in South African grape farms.

Spatial data science for seasonal malaria risk mapping at sub-national levels in Kenya,SPATIAL DATA SCIENCE FOR SEASONAL MALARIA RISK MAPPING AT SUB-NATIONAL LEVELS IN KENYA,"Programme: International Training Fellowship - Full. Description: Despite the recent investments in malaria, the burden in sub-Saharan Africa remains distributed unevenly between and within countries and its seasonal variation is poorly described at a sub-national level. Recent mapping efforts continue to rely on interpolation of parasite prevalence from community surveys. These surveys do not capture the intra-annual and seasonal variation of malaria risk and heterogeneity at sub-national scale. Test positivity rates from routine health facility data will be assembled and combined with climate data to improve a) mapping malaria risk and seasonality characterisation and b) malaria risk stratification and understating of uncertainty from routine data. Improving risk estimation, stratification and understating of uncertainty is important for disease control, targeting of interventions, and to understanding future data quality needs to track the impact of interventions. Improvement in data quality (through DHIS 2) provides a platform to improve our understanding of risk and seasonality. This, however, requires the development of scientific approaches for not only risk estimation but also interpreting biases or uncertainties related to information systems data and related products that support decision making. This proposal aims to address this need by improving and expanding upon current approaches of mapping malaria risk and stratification in Kenya.",Review,0.00163296156097204

"Conflict, Violence and Environmental Change: Investigating resource governance and legitimacy in transitional societies","CONFLICT, VIOLENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: INVESTIGATING RESOURCE GOVERNANCE AND LEGITIMACY IN TRANSITIONAL SOCIETIES","This aim of this 4-year program is to probe the concerns raised by environmental change for conflict and violence and to understand how we can respond more effectively to them. It does so by tackling a question identified by the recent IPCC report as a crucial question, what produces conflict and violence in the face of environmental change? The proposed research therefore begins from the insight that environmental governance policies and programs are often a platform on which actors struggle over discourses, authority and responsibilities. More scientific scrutiny is required into how such struggles within policies and programs can erupt as flash points for conflict and violence, or alternatively, can open up pathways towards peace and reduced vulnerability. Drawing from the social sciences the program explores how climate change is linked to perceptions of and responses to those changes. The work focuses on changes in forest and water resources in 2 countries: Nepal and Kenya. The objectives are: 1. To better conceptualise the social-political processes through which changing forest and water resources become enrolled in crises of legitimacy, conflict and violence. To produce empirical evidence of how global environmental change manifests social-politically within two carefully selected countries on two continents: Asia (Nepal) and Africa (Kenya). 3. To generate insights into how governance mechanisms can be better designed to address environmental conflict and violence concerns in least developed countries. The outcome will be a concrete evaluation of how conflict and environmental change together create new vulnerabilities and points of empowerment for people and polities.",Review,0.00149178202264011

A sticky situation: confronting the challenges of bacterial surface adhesion,A STICKY SITUATION: CONFRONTING THE CHALLENGES OF BACTERIAL SURFACE ADHESION,"Programme: Vacation Scholarships. Description: Certain bacterial species can colonise to form biofilms- large structures which protect bacteria from physical and chemical removal e.g. antibiotics. If adhered to biomedical implants, bacteria can cause repeated infections which couldnt be treated by antibiotics and therefore would lead to the removal of the implant. In some patients, this would result in repeated invasive surgery. Our interest is in crystalline biofilms which can block urinary catheters and cause catheter-associated urinary-tract-infections (CAUTI). The main bacterium causing CAUTI is E. Coli in which E. Niba et al. (2008) isolated 110 genes involved in the formation of biofilms. Mutations in key genes will be created using Lambda red recombination which is a highly efficient and well established method for creating precise gene deletions. Deletions will be confirmed using PCR and sequencing. The deletion mutants will be analysed for biofilm formation using a bioflux system which generates shear force by continuous flow of liquid. This is an open system ensuring nutrients are available and thereby favouring biofilm formation. Both pathotypes and their respective mutants will be tested for the capacity to form biofilms at a range of temperatures. Data from the above experiments will be quantified using ImageJ software. .

Description: I aim to elucidate how genetic diversity is achieved in the emerging multi-resistant fungal pathogen Candida auris and how this influences its drug resistance phenotype. Using genetic, genomic, and imaging approaches this project will determine why the strains of this fungus causing different outbreaks are highly variable, and how this diversity underpins its multi-drug resistance and other phenotypic characteristics. This project is based on hypotheses framed by pilot data that suggest that this fungus is sexually recombining with non-human host strains to generate novel pathogenic phenotypes. In Objective 1 I will determine whether (para)sexual reproduction generates genetic diversity in C. auris thus driving its evolution and dissemination. In Objective 2 I will establish how chromosomal variability maps onto the global population structure of this yeast and how this correlates with its drug resistance profile. In Objective 3 I will establish which genetic factors underlie the multi-drug resistance of clinical C. auris isolates. This project will provide crucially important mechanistic insight into the genetics of an emerging and dangerous human pathogen, C. auris, and has major implications for our understanding of its epidemiology, and significant potential to elucidate the origin of differences in drug resistance between clinical isolates of C. auris.",Review,0.00113163667265326

The projects expected results are: improved capacity of trade unions to promote the realization of workers rights, increased commitment by companies towards decent work, improved occupational and health and safety conditions on farms and more environmentally sustainable wine production. The project aims to work collaboratively, with value chain dialogue, to develop a strategy aimed at improving wages and get healthy, motivated productive workforce for the sector. The project improves capacity of trade unions to support mature systems of industrial relations as well as union presence on grape farms. The aim is to create employer-worker relations whereby workers and the management build a relationship based on trust, respect and regular dialogue to improve both working conditions and enable wage levels to be improved. The project will promote effective social dialogue among stakeholders who play key roles in influencing working conditions in the wine sector in South Africa. To ensure decent working conditions to tackle sexual harassment and gender discrimination, systems will be set where those dont exist already and enhanced where systems are in place. The key actors are the local trade union committees on the farms through which the key occupational health and safety hazards will be addressed. Key partners are ILRIG (International Labour Research and Information Group) and the trade unions in the sector. The project will have collaboration with Fair trade Finland and Fair trade Africa.",Review,0.00112339598126709
