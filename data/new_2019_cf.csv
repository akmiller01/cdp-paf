La situación de vulnerabilidad de la población de la Región VIII de Jocotán (Chiquimula) con relación a las necesidades materiales, se vincula directamente con la baja capacidad para producir granos básicos (por la sequía, las trombas de agua y las prácticas agrícolas deficientes), el bajo nivel de ingresos que perciben por su trabajo como jornaleros agrícolas y el incremento del precio de frijol (que hace aún más difícil acceder a este producto básico para la dieta familiar) y, en algunos casos, la pérdida de la segunda cosecha del 2017 por las copiosas lluvias (y por tanto, con la reducción de las reservas de granos básicos). La población de Jocotán (y especialmente la de la Región VIII) se ha visto desbordada por la emergencia, y no cuenta a estas alturas con reservas de granos básicos (maíz y frijol) para garantizar su alimentación. El agotamiento de las reservas (que eran limitadas) es total. Además, como las plantaciones de café que dan trabajo temporal a las y los campesinos de la zona también resultaron duramente afectadas por la canícula extendida, se ha reducido significativamente la demanda de mano de obra, lo que se traduce en ingresos económicos casi nulos para adquirir los alimentos que imperiosamente necesitan (unido al hecho de que, como se explicó, los precios del maíz y el frijol -que son la base de la dieta para estas familias- han sufrido incrementos en los últimos 6 meses, dificultando aún más el acceso de la población a estos granos básicos). La crisis alimentaria quedó en evidencia con el reciente caso de una familia del área rural de Jocotán, cuyos/as miembros sufrieron severos malestares al comer hongos.

The proposed work aligns with another IDRC-supported project, Harnessing the economic power of data in the Middle East and North Africa, which explores innovative technologies and approaches to improve data production, management, and usability in the Middle East and North Africa.Currently, the Syria Immunization Group is using basic applications to manage their information systems, which limits data collection, use, and analysis. With the increasing number of health facilities providing vaccines and immunization services in the northern part of the country, and because of the limited accessibility to vaccination data, the proposed project seeks to improve their health information management system. The initiative will be led by the Sustainable International Medical Relief Organization (SIMRO). SIMRO is a Syrian NGO, established in Turkey in 2014, that has been extensively involved in reactivating vaccination activities in northern Syria. New data collection, management, and usability tools will be piloted in this initiative, which will cover 10 facilities over a six-month period. It is estimated that the number of direct beneficiaries (i.e., children under the age of 10 and pregnant women in northern Syria) will be more than one million people.

Las personas beneficiarias seran fundamentalmente ninos/as, mujeres y personas ancianas con enfermedades cronicas (hipertension, anemia, diabetes y reumatismo) que de no recibir tratamiento continuo corren un alto riesgo incluso de muerte. En un contexto en el que la ocupacion militar israeli niega la libre circulacion a la poblacion palestina ocupada, y en donde las carencias del Servicio sanitario palestino son cada vez mayores, el presente proyecto se antoja imprescindible para poder iniciar y/o continuar con los tratamientos medicos basicos para las personas con este tipo de enfermedades. El trabajo de compra y distribucion de los medicamentos se llevara a cabo mediante la ONG palestina Health Work Comittees, experta desde hace mas de 20 años en abastecer y suministrar tratamientos en areas rurales mediante sus clinicas moviles.La atencion sanitaria se realizara en las zonas rurales y mas aisladas de los distritos de Ramallah, Nablus y Hebron, segun las necesidades de cada centro.

Led by the Government of Ethiopia, with support from Canada and other partners, this initiative aims to enhance household and community resilience to shocks, such as droughts, and improve household food security, nutrition and economic well-being in Ethiopia's most vulnerable communities. To achieve these objectives, the project provides food insecure households with predictable food or cash transfers. In exchange for these transfers, beneficiaries participate in public works activities to build community assets and improve watershed management, a number of these activities build resilience to climate change. The most vulnerable beneficiaries (e.g. elderly people and pregnant and lactating mothers) receive transfers without contributing their labour for public works. The project reach is up to 10 million rural beneficiaries.Project activities include: (1) providing cash and food transfers to food insecure households, (2) conducting livelihoods interventions (e.g. crop and livestock production, and off-farm income generating activities), (3) providing key health and nutrition services (e.g. behaviour change communication activities), (4) construction of community assets (e.g. land rehabilitation, health posts), and (5) offering capacity development activities.Canada's support to this program is provided through the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Bank. / Ce projet représente l'appui continu du Canada pour le Programme de protection des moyens de production de l'Éthiopie (PPMP).

Pour atteindre ces objectifs, le projet fournit aux ménages souffrant d'insécurité alimentaire des transferts prévisibles de vivres ou d'argent. En échange de ces transferts, les bénéficiaires participent à des activités de travaux publics pour construire des biens communautaires et améliorer la gestion des bassins versants. Certaines de ces activités renforcent la résilience au changement climatique. Les bénéficiaires les plus vulnérables (les personnes âgées, les femmes enceintes et qui allaitent) reçoivent des transferts directs sans participer aux travaux publics.

Atención médica y suministro de medicinas para población refugiada congoleña en el Campo de Refugiados de Lovua, Lunda Norte, ANGOLA :: El brote de violencia en la región de Kasai de la Rep.Dem.Congo (RDC) en marzo de 2017 provocó el desplazamiento interno de aproximadamente 1,4 millones de personas y más de 35.000 refugiados en la provincia de Lunda Norte en Angola. El flujo de llegadas disminuyó en julio de 2017 y el gobierno angoleño no aceptó más llegadas de personas refugiadas. La rebelión de Kamwina Nsapu, también conocida como la rebelión de Kamuina Nsapu, es una rebelión continua instigada por la milicia Kamwina Nsapu contra las fuerzas de seguridad del estado  en la República Democrática del Congo (RDC), en las provincias de Kasaï-Central, Kasaï, Kasai-Oriental, Lomami y Sankuru. Los combates comenzaron después de que la milicia liderada por Kamwina Nsapu atacara a las fuerzas de seguridad en agosto de 2016. Hay una naturaleza étnica en el conflicto con la milicia formada principalmente por lubos que han matado selectivamente a personas no lubas. El conflicto ha evolucionado a partir de una rebelión contra el estado para involucrar a la violencia étnica. A pesar del proceso de repatriación organizada voluntaria que se inició en octubre de 2019 en el campo de refugiados, las necesidades médicas en la zona siguen siendo altas. Se necesita contar con los medicamentos esenciales y materiales para ofrecer servicios de atención primaria de salud y salud mental  gratuitos y de calidad. Entre los medicamentos básicos indispensables están los antibióticos, antipiréticos, analgésico y antipalúdicos. La malaria, las infecciones respiratorias, diarreas y dolores musculoesqueléticos suponen un gran porcentaje de las consultas que se realizan en las clínicas, siendo el motivo de más de setecientas consultas de media semana. Otros medicamentos como antihipertensivos y antidiabéticos permiten el tratamiento de las patologías crónicas más frecuentes. Como consecuencia de las condiciones de vida, las cifras relativas a patologías como parasitosis o malnutrición se han ido incrementando. Con este incremento se hace indispensable el aumento de medicamentos, suplementos nutricionales y material dirigido, no sólo al tratamiento, sino también a la prevención. Es, por tanto, necesario la compra de medicamentos y del transporte de los mismos. A mitad de 2019 más de 20.000 personas provenientes de la RDC residen en el asentamiento de Lóvua.

Project: 12052 Inclusive actions for improving women's social status through skills, employment and economic development (INSWEED) 2. Project area and Country: Siem Reap province, Cambodia    3. Project justification: Women have fewer productive employment and decent work opportunities in Cambodia. Major challenges to be addressed include limited access to technical and vocational training that enable them to access job opportunities or promote women entrepreneurship. Furthermore, TVET is not popular among youth due to lack of information, and TVET services are not responding to labour market needs. Many Cambodians, especially youth, migrate abroad to seek for better livelihood. Poverty combined with the lack of information and education makes rural people vulnerable to illegal migration, trafficking and sexual exploitation in the destination countries. The project area is highly affected by migration.4. The main objective and the expected results: The main objective of the project is that adolescent girls and their families in the targeted areas are economically empowered and become more active members in their local communities. This will be accomplished through increased access to relevant and quality TVET services for adolescent girls and youth.The project will also enhance adolescent girls' and women's access to jobs and/or establish micro businesses and improve their vocational and soft skills. The project will work with the parents and local communities to increase their support to girls' education and participation in TVET. Furthermore, FCA will contribute its expertise to enhance the quality of TVET services. 5.

The Mekong Delta region is particularly vulnerable to climate change and flood-related disasters. At the same time the Delta is heavily populated and the country's third largest industrial region. The vulnerability to flooding thus creates a large negative impact on the socio-economic development not only of the region, but also to the economic development of the whole of Vietnam. Climate change and uncontrolled urbanisation further impact the overall situation negatively.

Official structures also lack the capacity to implement the reconciliation agenda. FCA has been implementing the Right to Peace (R2P) programme In CAR since 2013, with the main objective of advancing reconciliation and mediation, focusing on working with the local peace committees. #The start of the new programme period 2018-2023 provides an excellent opportunity to assess FCAs earlier peace work and to discuss the successes and lessons learnt in order to promote sustainable and impactful results. The rapidly changing context and needs require and justify a deeper analysis of the context in CAR, especially with regard the current conflict dynamics and promotion of sustainable peace.#4. The main objective and expected results:#The project will build on the lessons learnt from FCAs earlier R2P work in CAR and the results and recommendations of the assessments to be conducted in April-May 2018. The subsequent analysis will contribute to strengthen FCAs peace programming in CAR and to enhance its quality. The key activities for the first half of the year include the context analysis focused on FCA strategic lines (to be funded by FCA) and a thematic peace assessment that will provide the necessary knowledge and information for the development of the follow-up peace project in CAR, due to start in June/July 2018.

The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the stability and resilience of 93 communities in the five states South Kordofan, Blue Nile, West Kordofan, White Nile and North Kordofan. The targeted communities were selected on the basis of a multidimensional poverty and conflict exposure analysis conducted by UNDP and are characterized by being on the verge of conflict, suffering from high unemployment rates (particularly among women and youths) and/or hosting large groups of IDPs/refugees/migrants. Limited economic opportunities and resource scarcity has further exacerbated development challenges in many of these communities and are likely to contribute to distress and conflicts in the near future if left unaddressed. The programme aims at building inclusive livelihoods and strengthen socio-economic resilience of the targeted communities by addressing the specific needs of e.g. unemployed youth, displaced population and women at risk.The programme budget is US$ 17,066,000.  Other donors include Japan, Italy, UK and Spain. The programme has recently (January 2018) entered into its second phase during which it is planning to reach a minimum of 9,300 direct and 279,000 indirect beneficiaries in the prioritized communities. Sida is considering a support of approx. 45 000 000 SEK during 2018-2020.The specific objectives of the programme are:1) To strengthen the resilience of unemployed youth who have the potential to be radicalized and mobilized to join conflicts by the provision of livelihood support and generation of the rural economy in the southern States bordering South Sudan2) To promote stability and peace-building by strengthening the resilience of communities hosting refugees and migrants from South Sudan and IDPs resulting from internal conflict by providing socio-economic infrastructure and assets to benefit all.3) To enhance the capacity of peacebuilding structures at the community, state, and national levels to continue promoting and engaging in peace initiatives, positive transformation of youth, networking and provide space for dialogue and learning.Programme activities focus on 1) providing alternative livelihoods for unemployed youth through, e.g., farming activities, vocational skills training, workshops and awareness raising, 2) replacement of basic infrastructure (e.g. water pumps) in conflict-ridden communities, 3) strengthening of community resilience and social cohesion, 4) capacity development of Community Management Committees (CMCs) and local government entities. Start-up support for local businesses, facilitation of linkages with the private sector and financial institutions, creation of short-term jobs and support to community-based initiatives will also form part of the comprehensive programme.","Civilian peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution",Yes,0.985374212265015

The extension application for 2018 is based on the application for 2015-2017 and focuses on changes and news. Most of the policies that formed the basis for the operations during the current agreement period are also valid in 2018. KtK has a new strategy for the period 2016-2021, but this is entirely in line with the program under the CSO-strategy.The expected impact of the programme is  increased fulfilment of women's rights within the Women, Peace and Security agenda in conflict affected regions . The expected results are more or less the same as in the on-going agreement. The programme is divided into four main thematic areas:1. Women in Peacebuilding (WiP)2. Gender Based Violence (GBV)3. Advocacy4. Sustainable women's rights organisationsThe programme is also divided into four components:1. The Global component 2. MENA (Iraq, Lebanon, Palestine and Israel)3. South Caucasus (Armenia and Azerbaijan)4. Western Balkans (Kosovo, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia)The inclusion of Israel and Macedonia is new in the 2018 application. The total number of partner organisations is 44, of which nine are new to the programme. However, KtK has on-going cooperation with eight of these. Thus, only one organisation is new as partner to KtK. The total amount applied for 2018 is 36 510 215 SEK. This is an increase by 6 569 103 SEK (equal to 22 percent) compared to the agreed amount 2017. In accordance with the guidelines for the CSO-appropriation the amount is divided into two categories.Grants to operational costs:33 805 755 SEKGrants to administrative costs:                  2 704 460 SEK The total budget for the programme 2018 is 40 266 410 SEK and this amount includes KtK's own contribution of 3 756 195 SEK amounting to 10 percent of the total operational costs. The grant to the administrative costs equals 8 percent of Sida's contribution to the operational costs. This is in accordance with the guidelines for the CSO-appropriation. The increased budget compared to 2017 consists mainly of the following changes: 1. the inclusion of Israel and Macedonia into the programme 2. special activities related to security and anti-corruption in the Western Balkans component and improvements in digital security  3. increased costs for regional managers The budget is allocated between the different components as follows:The Global component  9 781 000 SEK (26 percent)MENA                 11 950 000 SEK  (32 percent)South Caucasus                    7 835 000 SEK (21 percent)Western Balkans                    7 995 950 SEK (21 percent)Of the total budget, 46 percent is sub-granted in accordance with agreements with local partner organisations.

2018004311-1,Reduction of vulnerability and protection of Human Rights,REDUCTION OF VULNERABILITY AND PROTECTION OF HUMAN RIGHTS,"Título completo del proyecto: Reducción de la vulnerabilidad y protección de Derechos Humanos :: Este proyecto plantea, por un lado, la rehabilitación de tierras y medios de vida de agricultores/as de la comunidad de Al-Walajeh promoviendo la resiliencia de las comunidades ante la ocupación israelí. Y por otro, recoger las violaciones de DDHH en Palestina y sensibilizar a titulares de responsabilidades y obligaciones.Al Walajeh, o Al Walaja (2.569 habitantes), la comunidad en la que se pretende desarrollar este proyecto, es una comunidad palestina que se encuentra en una situación extrema, de gravísima vulnerabilidad, y que requiere actuaciones humanitarias urgentes.Considerada por Palestina como una comunidad perteneciente al Gobernorado de Belén (ciudad de la que se encuentra a unos 7 kilómetros lineales), es parte de las pretensiones de expansión de Israel. Más de la mitad de la comunidad se encuentra dentro de los límites unilateralmente establecidos por la municipalidad de Jerusalén como parte de Jerusalén Oeste (el lado israelí de Jerusalén), pese a que está en el lado palestino de la línea verde.  Además, toda la comunidad está rodeada por el muro de separación construido (o planificado) por Israel y declarado ilegal por la Corte Internacional de Justicia en 2004, lo que supone que la población sólo puede entrar y salir de la comunidad por un solo punto: el paso de Har Gilo. Según organizaciones como Amnistía Internacional, el 85% del muro se encuentra situado dentro del territorio palestino, incumpliendo así los límites de la mencionada Línea Verde. Esto supone una gran pérdida de tierras para la población palestina, que en la mayoría de los casos ha visto cómo parte de las tierras cultivables, viviendas, negocios y pozos han quedado situados más allá del Muro, impidiendo posteriormente el acceso a estas tierras de sus legítimos/as propietarios/as, con la consecuente pérdida de poder adquisitivo y de sus medios de vida. Para acceder a esta parte de territorio, la población palestina necesita permisos especiales que les permitan el acceso a estas tierras que se encuentran entre la Línea Verde y el muro y que han sido declaradas por el Estado de Israel como ?zona de exclusión?.Actividades: - Crear un mecanismo de rendición de cuentas para presentación de reclamaciones por parte de la población destinataria, de acuerdo con la Norma Esencial Humanitaria nº 5, Zona C, Al Walajeh, Gobernorado de Belén, Cisjordania, Palestina.- Restablecer y potenciar las capacidades productivas de 12 familias vulnerables (72 personas: 35mujeres y niñas, 37 hombres y niños) cuyos medios de vida están amenazados, - Recuperar 50 dunums (5 HA) de tierras en riesgo de confiscación, fuente de medios de vida de 12 familias vulnerables, - Mejorar el acceso de 2 familias vulnerables (12 personas: 6 mujeres y niñas, 6 hombres y niños) al agua para el riego de tierras en riesgo de confiscación, fuente de medios de vida de las familias destinatarias, - Rehabilitadas 2 cist",Material relief assistance and services,Yes,0.981846392154694

The assessment results revealed significant negative impact from chronic water shortage and drought, therefore the project aims to enhance disaster resilience on droughts through improving access to water and agricultural practice that is more drought resilient.  Specifically, the project will provide water related information to the community for improving awareness on DRR in the area, improve access to drinking water, and improve access to agricultural water source and technology which can reduce vulnerability of the drought affected community.  In order to ensure sustainability, the project aims to build a mechanism in which community takes the ownership for maintaining and managing the activities and the assets of the project upon completion.  And the project will carry out information dissemination on technicality of the model used in the project so that it will be considered as a model process for other drought affected areas in Pakistan.

This widespread social problem is addressed at work place and community levels through developing social dialogue and collective agreements, awareness raising, up keeping six ex-CL schools, strengthening unions and enhancing terms and conditions at work places. The use of CL is still a massive social problem, which contribute to impoverishment. Children have a fundamental right to be children, to play, and the working belongs entirely to adults. On its worst, widespread use of child labor, prevent enhancement of principles of decent work. The access to schooling is a significant threshold to child laborers and their families. Health education and the work in Self Help Groups (SHG) offer benefits, which are often unique to poor families. In order to unions being able to continue offering these type of services to their members beyond the project cycle, it is crucial to continuously built unions' capacities and resources. Immediate results will be the up keeping of the six ex-child labor schools, which intake 540 pupils. In addition, 1 000 pupils will be transferred to Government schools.

This widespread social problem is addressed at work place and community levels through developing social dialogue and collective agreements, awareness raising, up keeping six ex-CL schools, strengthening unions and enhancing terms and conditions at work places. The use of CL is still a massive social problem, which contribute to impoverishment. Children have a fundamental right to be children, to play, and the working belongs entirely to adults. On its worst, widespread use of child labor, prevent enhancement of principles of decent work. The access to schooling is a significant threshold to child laborers and their families. Health education and the work in Self Help Groups (SHG) offer benefits, which are often unique to poor families. In order to unions being able to continue offering these type of services to their members beyond the project cycle, it is crucial to continuously built unions' capacities and resources. Immediate results will be the up keeping of the six ex-child labor schools, which intake 540 pupils. In addition, 1 000 pupils will be transferred to Government schools. Around 120 pupils will receive vocational training. Unions aim to achieve over 40 000 new members. Fifteen work place committees and twenty SHGs are established.

Although mass-starvation has killed staggering numbers of people, it is usually not conceptualized as mass-violence. Victims are rarely commemorated and actors responsible are not held accountable – despite the fact that famines are largely man-made. The proposed project aims to analyze the attempts and possibilities to pursue remembrance and justice after famines. It studies (1) under what conditions, how and by whom famines are understood, remembered and dealt with as mass-atrocities. This is done through a historical study of six famines in Africa, Asia and Europe. The project also analyzes (2) contemporary initiatives to push for remembrance and justice for hunger deaths, for instance by intergovernmental organizations, civil society groups, legal professionals, victim groups and states. Theoretically, the project understands conceptualizations of violence, memorialization and pursuit of justice as interconnected. Methodologically, the project will draw on earlier literature, archival research and media sources, and also carry out interviews with experts and key actors involved in projects of commemoration and justice. Bringing attention to the structural violence of famines, and gaining a systematic understanding of the opportunities and obstacles to bring those responsible to justice and commemorate victims will contribute to the important endeavor of preventing famines in the future.",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.979201555252075

Se complementará con capacitaciones para el mantenimiento de dichas infraestructuras y con actividades de sensibilización en higiene y recogida adecuada de residuos.CONTEXTO: Desde febrero de 2003 se están produciendo enfrentamientos en Darfur, al oeste de Sudán, entre milicias apoyadas por el Gobierno de Sudán (Janjaweed Muraheleen y Fuerzas Populares de Defensa) y los grupos armados de oposición, Sudan People?s Liberation Movement (SPLM) y Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), la mayoría del grupo étnico Fur (formado por las tribus Dajo, Masalit, Tama, Tanjur y Zaghawa). La larga guerra civil sudanesa continúa teniendo consecuencias nefastas en la región de Darfur dando lugar a un enorme estado de volatilidad.Chad es uno de los países más pobres del mundo, y también uno de los que mayor población refugiada acoge en su territorio. A 30 de noviembre de 2018, la población refugiada y solicitante de asilo en Chad era de 450.798 personas, viviendo en 22 campos, 23 comunidades de acogida y 2 áreas urbanas (N?Djamena y Bongor). La mayoría de las personas refugiadas son procedentes de la región sudanesa de Darfur (337.175 personas), aunque el conflicto en la República Centroafricana ha provocado un aumento considerable de población refugiada procedente de este país.En este contexto político y de seguridad inestable, ACNUR ha estado ejecutando su Programa General en Chad desde 2003, con la puesta en marcha de operaciones humanitarias en favor de los/as refugiados/as, de las personas desplazadas y de las poblaciones de acogida, incluso si a veces las agencias humanitarias se han visto obligadas a restringir sus movimientos entre los campos o a proceder a una reducción de personal por motivos de seguridad.OBJETIVOS:General: Mejorar las condiciones de vida de la población refugiada sudanesa en los campos del este de Chad.Específico: Mejorar el acceso a agua potable y a servicios adecuados de saneamiento de 68.877 refugiados/as (de los que 40.211 serán mujeres y 28.666 hombres - en su mayoría adultos y de edades comprendidas entre 5 y 11 años) en tres campos de población refugiada sudanesa en Chad.ACTIVIDADES:A.1.1 Rehabilitación y mantenimiento de 3 pozos en los campos de ejecución del proyecto A.1.2 Mantenimiento y ampliación de las redes de distribución de agua existentes en los campos de implementación del proyecto A.2.1 Construcción de infraestructuras de saneamiento en los 3 campos de intervención del proyecto A.3.1 Establecimiento y funcionamiento de comités de gestión de aguaA.3.2.

The ERSP program cluster aims to assist Samoa's economic recovery and movement to a higher medium-term growth rate, following the double impact of the global economic crisis and the September 2009 tsunami. Subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support improved fiscal management and structural measures that will place the economy on a sustainable medium-term growth path. Budget support will help create the fiscal space to enable raised levels of capital spending over the medium term. This will be complemented by measures that enable targeting of services to protect the vulnerable and by engagement with key stakeholders. Subprogram 2 completes the program reform agenda under the ERSP program cluster. Subprogram 2 is consistent with the strategic focus of the country partnership strategy for Samoa (2008-2012) to address binding constraints to growth, including deficiencies in access to public services and in the quality of public service delivery, and weaknesses in the private sector-enabling environment. Subprogram 2 of the ERSP program cluster supports the government's economic and financial reform program in coordination with key development partners including Australia, the European Union and the World Bank. The national elections, in March 2011, slowed the formulation and implementation of policy and as such proved a challenge to the program cluster. Subsequent to this, the government remains strongly committed to continuing dialogue with development partners.

Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones. With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings. The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city s geohazard management system. The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou.

The 2016 Leaders' Summit on Refugees highlighted the fact that: no routine mechanism exists yet to facilitate the kind of voluntary responsibility-sharing for refugees…or to more comprehensively address other challenges arising from large-scale refugee crises. In response, states participating in the Summit committed themselves to …develop tools and institutional structures to improve the international architecture and lay a foundation for addressing both the immediate and the long-term challenges of managing refugee flows effectively and comprehensively. States also adopted the New York Declaration, which outlined key principles relating to large movements of refugees and migrants, and began a process to negotiate a global compact on refugees and a global compact on migration, both by mid-2018. The World Refugee Council was created to build on the momentum generated by the summit to confront the structural and political constraints of the current refugee system, to develop effective, predictable, fair, and just approaches to international cooperation, and to promote its findings globally and regionally during the negotiation of a global compact for refugees. This project, implemented by the Waterloo, Ontario-based Centre for International Governance Innovation, seeks to promote evidence-based analysis that will lead to the development of actionable recommendations aimed at transforming the refugee response system. It will facilitate dialogue between a wide range of actors on the deficiencies and limitations of the current global refugee regime, identify, develop, and propose approaches, mechanisms, innovations, and instruments to address gaps in the current regime and shortcomings in state compliance with it, and generate the necessary political support for implementation of the Council's recommendations.",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Yes,0.973523676395416

Though shrouded in secrecy, transactional sex is widespread among forcibly displaced populations. Women, men (heterosexual and homosexual) and transgender refugees resort to transactional sex for various reasons, including to meet their basic needs, raise sufficient money to continue their journey, or in exchange for security. In most cases, refugees who engage in transactional sex are at greater risk of physical and sexual violence, mental health problems, unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and HIV/sexually transmitted infections. The silence and stigma around transactional sex — especially among young women — and the poor understanding of the role of gender relations as a driver hinder access to health services and rights to health, privacy, and freedom from violence and discrimination.This comparative, multi-disciplinary, and multi-country research study will examine the gendered nature of transactional sex and the sexual and reproductive health and rights trajectories among refugee women, girls, and sexual minority persons, with the aim of developing appropriate interventions to improve policy and programmatic responses. The methodological approach will use ethnographic and qualitative methods in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey and will include preparing and piloting comparative quantitative surveys. The main analysis will describe the impact of transactional sex on sexual and reproductive health with a focus on needs and barriers to these services. This proposed research is part of a larger multi-country research program in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Sweden to examine the pattern and experiences of transactional sex and its sexual and reproductive health and rights implications across refugees' migration journeys originating in the Middle East, and in transit en route to desired safe destinations.The study will generate unique evidence to inform public health policies and interventions addressing transactional sex in refugee populations. The research will influence change by fostering a community of practice with local researchers, community members, program managers, policymakers, and other practitioners.

The floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing 32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at $55 million. The Project aims to help Tajikistan address recurring flood risks through a holistic and coordinated approach involving both physical and non-physical measures in one of the most floodprone areas in the country - Hamadoni, Farkhor, Kulyab, and Vose districts in Khatlon province. A major part of the Project funds will be used for the physical works for the rehabilitation of 8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In addition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, strengthen flood warning systems, prepare a flood preparedness and evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by rehabilitating the hydrometeorological network. Given that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the possible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan were examined. The initial environment examination study found that there is unlikely to be significant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on ecological resources and socioeconomic conditions in the area. In addition, the project will help the Government define and implement the policy reforms needed to improve its flood preparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and maintenance (O&M) funding constraints for the flood levees and bank protection works. The Project will strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the local government bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to apply need-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for the flood protection structures.

2018064638A,Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility - LoCAL - Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility- LoCAL,LOCAL CLIMATE ADAPTIVE LIVING FACILITY - LOCAL - LOCAL CLIMATE ADAPTIVE LIVING FACILITY- LOCAL,"Mozambique's climate provides challenges in the form of droughts, floods and cyclones. Global climate change brings more extreme weather events, which means increased risk for and problems with unstable food production and food security, water stress, increased sea levels, catastrophes, changing ecosystems, lack of biodiversity, and human health. Mozambique's chances to achieve goals for sustainable development are at risk if climate change adaptation is not addressed, not least at the local level. Local Adaptation Plans (LAPs/PLAs) have been developed in the country's vulnerable districts, but they are mostly not being implemented due to lack of funds and other capacities, It is however a priority that they be implemented.UNCDF has since 2011, at global level, run the programme LoCAL (Local Climate Adaptive Living) to deliver climate finance solutions for local governments in developing countries, partially using Swedish funding through Sida (54040181 Financial Inclusion, 54020137 Leveraging Domestic Finance and 61050459 Last Mile Financing Trust Fund (ongoing)). The programme is now being replicated at country level in Asia and in Africa. In Mozambique, UNCDF developed a country programmatic framework and initiated a pilot project in Gaza province starting 2015, with additional financing from the Belgian Cooperation. The proposed contribution  Local Climate Adaptive Living - LoCAL Mozambique  is a first upscaling phase of the already ongoing pilot project. It aims to reduce the vulnerability of the rural population and improve resilience to climate change at district level through increase in access to climate change adaptation financing through performance-based climate resilient grants (PBCRGs). The main expected results are (in short):1. Effective financing mechanism established and operationalised.2. Climate change mainstreamed in district planning and budgeting.3. Climate Change resilient investments (infrastructure and services)4. Monitoring and evaluation for Learning.5. Preparations for national upscale phase (from 2023 and onwards).The proposed programme will be implemented during 2018-2023 in the districts of Massingir, Guijá, Mabalane och Chicualacuala in the Gaza province (ongoing pilot phase since 2015) with gradual upscaling in these districts and replication in Chigubo, Massangena, Chókwe and Chibuto districts in Gaza and to the districts of Jangamo, Panda, Funhalouro, Govuro and Mabote in the Inhambane province. The selection of districts has been done on the basis of an analysis of vulnerability to climate change, in consultation with concerned stakeholders. The Embassy of Sweden (herefafter EoS) will sign a financing agreement with the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF)(New York Headquarters), with programme management handled from their local representation in Maputo, Mozambique.

Cox's Bazar is one of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable districts, with the poverty rate well above the national average. Even before the influx, 33% of the host community population lived below the poverty line and 17% below the extreme poverty line. The arrival of the refugees has increased the supply of labour in the affected areas, driving down wages and increasing competition in the labour market, with a particular impact on the poorest host community households including those whose primary source of income is day labour. The influx has also put immense pressure on the availability and delivery of essential health services which were already scarce and overstretched. Women and girls, and women-headed households, are particularly vulnerable in this situation, including to gender-based violence which is likely to increase in times of economic stress.The project is designed to meet the immediate needs of the affected host communities in selected sub-districts in Cox's Bazar, while building skills, resilience and awareness to facilitate their long-term well-being. With a focus on empowering and girls, the objective is to lift the most affected host communities out of poverty through a program that combines livelihoods, social safety nets, financial inclusion and social integration. Activities include: providing grants and related support to ultra-poor women for income generation activities such as home gardening and poultry-rearing, , improving household food  consumption, employment-linked apprenticeship training for out-of-school youth and adolescents (male and female), facilitating production and retailing of traditional clothing materials by women artisans, and targeted training of community health workers and midwives to help address the essential health needs of the most vulnerable host communities. The activities are expected to directly benefit over 10,000 women and young adults and reach over 200,000 members of their households. / Ce projet vise à offrir un soutien à la subsistance complet aux personnes, en particulier les femmes, les filles et les adolescents, qui vivent dans les communautés hôtes de Cox's Bazar touchées par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 Rohingyas déplacés depuis août 2017. Cox's Bazar est un des districts les plus pauvres et les plus vulnérables du Bangladesh, le taux de pauvreté y est beaucoup plus élevé que la moyenne nationale. Même avant l'afflux des Rohingyas, 33 % de la population de ces communautés vivait sous le seuil de la pauvreté, et 17 %, sous le seuil de l'extrême pauvreté. L'arrivée des réfugiés a fait augmenter l'offre d'emploi dans les régions touchées, entraînant une baisse des salaires et une augmentation de la concurrence sur le marché du travail, ce qui a eu des répercussions graves sur les ménages les plus pauvres des communautés hôtes, y compris ceux pour lesquels la principale source de revenus est le travail journalier. L'afflux de réfugiés a aussi imposé une pression immense sur la disponibilité et la prestation des services de santé essentiels, qui se faisaient déjà rares. Les femmes et les filles ainsi que les ménages dirigés par une femme, sont particulièrement vulnérables dans cette situation, notamment à la violence fondée sur le sexe, qui a tendance à augmenter en période de stress économique.Le projet est conçu de manière à combler les besoins immédiats des communautés hôtes touchés dans certains sous-districts de Cox's Bazar, tout en renforçant les compétences, la résilience et la sensibilisation nécessaires à leur bien-être à long terme. Dans l'objectif de renforcer le pouvoir des femmes et des filles, il est prévu de sortir de la pauvreté les communautés hôtes les plus touchées à l'aide d'un programme a",Employment creation,Yes,0.966489851474762

The intervention, which has been initiated jointly by Sida and UNHCR, aims at improving livelihoods and resilience of refugees and host communities through financial inclusion and increased livelihood options for refugees and host communities, by: 1) fostering self-employment and income generating activities by supporting start-ups and expansion of existing business activities through micro-credit loans, 2)  enhancing refugees' business skills and financial literacy through the provision of non-financial services, 3) facilitating refugees' employment by supporting small businesses lending among the host population in those sectors where refugees, in accordance with the country's laws, can be employed. The program generally follows a market-based approach which involves partnering with a specialized micro-finance foundation, the GCAMF, which will provide debt funding to a number of financial service providers (FSPs) willing to lend to refugees. The Foundation will be recipient of a partial credit guarantee from Sida which will be used in case the FSPs default due to borrowers not being able of repaying back their loan. The program also has a Technical Assistance (TA) facility.While the intervention is a joint initiative of Sida and UNHCR, UNHCR is not the main cooperation partner though it has been and remains to be an essential partner in the design, planning as well as implementation of the project.  The formal cooperation partner is Grameen Crédit Agricole Microfinance Foundation (GCAMF), a Foundation registered in Luxembourg in September 2008. The mission of the Foundation is to contribute to the fight against poverty. GCAMF was selected through a call for applications for microfinance funds that was conducted by UNHCR back in 2017. Subsequently, Sida commissioned a review of its internal management and control system. The review was conducted by KPMG in 2017 and its overall assessment was that the organization has the necessary capacity, competencies and systems for the implementation of the intervention. In consultation with UNHCR and Sida, GCAMF has also identified three financial service providers (FSPs): BRAC Uganda, VisionFund Uganda, and UGAFODE as main implementing partners of the project in Uganda.  Financial literacy and business development trainings will also be provided by NGOs who have the competency and the experience the task demands. VisionFund Uganda and BRAC Uganda have NGO wings that have experience in providing such training and capacity building services. Ugafode FSP will work with the Jesuit Refugee Service (JSR) to provide these services.

Insofar and as an influential member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Kenya also plays an important regional role in setting migration policy standards in the Horn of Africa. In most cases, displacement is protracted and refugees remain in the camps for years without freedom of movement and no opportunity to access education or employment. Despite the persistent challenges linked to Kenya's refugee response, the call for reforms of the national refugee legislation, has recently found its way into Kenyan politics, leading to an important window of opportunity. Against this background Switzerland envisages to strengthen its cooperation with the Refugee Consortium of Kenya (RCK), a national NGO advocating for the rights of refugees in Kenya. RCK has lately become a strategically important actor, as the NGO was appointed a member of the National Task Force on the Refuge Act, where RCK represents the voice of the civil society in the revision of Kenya's refugee legislation.

In light of highly uncertain prospects for a prompt return to Syria in safety and dignity, the Jordan government and the international community have engaged considerable economic and political resources in order to enhance the protection and socio-economic integration of Syrian refugees.

Asylum Access uses a three pillar approach, focusing on (i) capacity building for advocacy effectiveness, (ii) fostering exchange among Non Governmental Organisation working on refugee protection at the national level through the organization together with UNHCR of a global convening on legal empowerment best practices in Geneva and (iii) connecting national Non Governmental Organisation to the global dialogue on international refugee protection.","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.951072871685028

2019002066,GCRF: Forced displacement,GCRF: FORCED DISPLACEMENT,"This project seeks to systematically explore some recent successes by local providers of legal aid to refugees in such situations and to determine whether these successes can form the basis for a new approach to refugee protection. Working with four leading providers of legal aid to refugees in the Middle East and Asia, the project will evaluate the experiences of refugees, lawyers and legal aid organisations in using innovative legal arguments and frameworks to protect refugees. The project will support the mapping of the relevant local legal frameworks through doctrinal legal analysis, interviews and workshops with legal experts, and discussion with refugee community leaders. The project will provide funding to local lawyers to pursue legal advocacy for the rights of refugees drawing on a range of innovative sources of law, including other international treaties, local constitutional law, various local legislative provisions, local jurisprudence, and common-law principles. It will collect detailed stories about 120 of these legal encounters, these stories will be documented over time, using a range of material, and from multiple points of view. Forty of the stories will be turned in to multi-media, digital stories for further online discussion and advocacy. The project will work closely with project partners. Three international workshops will ensure that partners receive training and capacity building in the research methods of the project and fully participate in the analysis of the data produced by the project. The findings of the project will be shared with the scholarly and professional communities through sub-regional workshops hosted in each of the four countries under study and through the presentation of the findings at a range of international conferences and meetings. The goal of the project is to support new refugee legal aid programming in the Global South, particularly in places where such programming has been overlooked because either or both the lack of the Refugee Convention and the absence of local refugee legislation. It aims to develop a better understanding of the process of litigation and factors that influence its success. As both the UN more generally and UNHCR more specifically move towards a renewed emphasis on the rule of law, the project will suggest pathways to protection that are consistent with this new emphasis and which pay attention to the expertise and agency of local legal and refugee communities.",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.946223497390747

The level of education for refugees and local people in the region is low and illiteracy in the area is even lower than the country average 52%. The aim of the project is to contribute towards the fulfilment of right to education and to enhance the resilience of participants and communities. The project provides adult education for both refugees and local residents in Bahn camp and in the refugee hosting communities in Nimba as well as in Liberian communities in Bong. As a result of the training, knowledge and participation will improve and social cohesion of the communities will be strengthened. As the project increases the literacy of the population, it creates a forum for discussion on community development issues and encourage self-initiated development contributing to improved well-being. The project has human rights based approach enabling participation of refugees and community membes to planning and implementation of the activities. Majority of the participants will be women whose participation in decision making and development activities will increase due to improved self-esteem and communication skills. Existing inequalities are reduced by offering equal learning opportunies also to other marginalised groups. With literacy and other skills gained during the project participants capacity to adopt to changing climate will increase. The project beneficiaries are adult learners (Ivorian refugees and Liberians), trained community based facilitators,  community literacy management committee members and their family members.

The phenomenon has profound negative impacts on the lives of refugees and migrants worldwide. From a Human Security perspective, developing and implementing alternatives to detention (ATD) is therefore a key area of foreign policy engagement. International Detention Coalition (IDC) is a network of more than 400 non-governmental organizations, academics and practitioners. Through its unique member-network, IDC builds on growing international commitments to ATD in order to implement reform of detention practices tailored to the national contexts in several key countries in cooperation with civil society actors. IDC acts as a catalyst and facilitator of change, bringing together key stakeholders in order to develop shared strategies. The cooperation with IDC strengthens the HSD's partnership network and impact in this area.","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.907756447792053

The aim is to decrease morbidity and mortality of internally displaced refugees. The project is planned to take place in 2 locations – Dawoodia refugee camp (with more than 8,000 inhabitants) and 5 countryside locations in Dohuk Province (Sharya, Sina, Sheladze, Balqosh and Gersheen) as both of them struggle with access to health care, which will be significantly improved after the project implementation. The following results are expected: Result #1: Access to health care services in Dawoodia camp. Thanks to the implementation of the project at least 9,600 refugess will be provided access to health care services in the already existing health center located in the camp. Due to lack of financial resources and lack of personnel the health center could be used only in limited scope. More than 5,000 children (under the age of 5) are expected to be treated during the duration of the project. In addition, at least 800 pregnant women will be provided health care services and 900 children will be enrolled in the vaccination program. Medical doctor will be employed and the health center will be regularly supplied with necessary medical equipment according to the patients'needs Result #2: Access to health care services in Dohuk Province thanks to a mobile health center Currently countryside locations of Sharya, Sina, Sheladze, Balqosh and Gersheen have no access to health care services. The main reason is the lack of proper infrastructure and lack of health care professionals (medical doctors & nurses) as well as proper equipment. As a result of the project implementation a mobile health center will be created and at least 9,600 patients are expected to be treated during the duration of the project and a medical doctor is expected to be hired. Result #3: Improved nutrition for children in Dawoodia camp thanks to a antimalnutrition center There are approximatelz 1,500 children (under 5) in Dawoodia camp who are currently under threat of malnutrition. The project will ensure nutritional screeding for children as well as their subsequent treatment. In order to achieve the planned results the following acitivities are expected to take place: • Selection of medical doctor for a health center in Dawoodia camp • Operation of a health center in Dawoodia camp • Selection of medical doctor for the mobile health center • Operation of a mobile health center • Operation of an anti-malnutrition center in Dawoodia camp Implementation of the project will lead to better health care of internally displaced refugees. As a result, better access to health care services will have positive effect on their migration plans - many of them would be less willing to continue their migration to European countries once they are ensured access to quality health care services.

Refugees continue to face difficulties on integrating on the socio-economic level. This has led to many migrants and refugees often resorting to engagement in the informal sector mainly through operating small-scale businesses, with women preferring home-based businesses to avoid harassment at work or on the streets.

Protracted conflict and growing populations of refugees and other displaced people have defined the region in recent years. Past gains made in accessing women's health and reproductive health services are losing ground.

Growing risks related to SRH for this age group include sexual and gender-based violence, early marriage, and resulting SRH-related illnesses and deaths.

This project is being implemented in collaboration with the Middle East and North Africa Health Policy Forum, an independent non-governmental forum to discuss health policy issues in the region. The aim of the project is to develop a regional, sustainable, gender-responsive, and evidence-based multi-sectoral adolescent sexual and reproductive health framework in Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon, and Morocco. The framework will address adolescent SRH issues as they pertain to education, communication, social norms, and legal frameworks. Using a gender and rights-based approach, this framework will be developed with different actors, including adolescent boys and girls, and will be tested and refined to optimize its uptake and influence. The project will produce position papers for each of the four countries, as well as targeted analyses and briefs for specific user groups.

The Jobs Compact arose in the follow-up to the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants, and its annex entitled the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2016. The project builds on ongoing work to implement the CRRF and coordinate efforts to enhance refugee self-reliance in Ethiopia, which has been identified by UNHCR, in consultation with its member States, as one of the pilot countries for this exercise as part of the process in the lead-up to a Global Compact for Refugees. ILO interventions will be framed within the ILO-UNHCR Memorandum of Understanding, as revised on 2016, and the ensuing operational joint plan of action to concretize this institutional partnership.The project will focus on: (1) strengthening ILO strategic positioning in the national refugee response and leveraging new opportunities to support the implementation of the Jobs Compact and the identification of a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, (2) enhancing the capacity of relevant government institutions and of the social partners to support the implementation of the Jobs Compact, (3) identifying the labour market demand requirements as well as potential sectors for job creation, (4) supporting a sustainable supply chain approach, and (5) conducting pilot activities.  Interventions will draw on the experience of the ILO's Syrian refugee response in Jordan and Turkey, and will offer opportunities to operationalize the ILO Guiding Principles on the access of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to the labour market, and to apply the Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience, 2017 (No. 205), in particular by supporting the active engagement of ILO tripartite constituents in the implementation of the Jobs Compact.This project contributes to the country's efforts to advance towards the achievement of SDG targets 8.8 (Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrant, and those in precarious employment) and 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe and regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies).","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.893162190914154

This project will generate evidence to support effective, integrated and scalable early childhood development interventions for disadvantaged populations in low- and middle-income countries. The project will investigate how underprivileged and marginalized environments threaten the development of children and their families. It will identify factors that build resilience in the face of these threats, especially for those who are displaced or are refugees from conflict. It will develop and validate culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive and affordable interventions that will benefit a large number of children and families. The project will then assess the effectiveness of an integrated package of interventions in critical areas of child development in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, that is home to internally and externally displaced families. It will examine the feasibility and affordability of the package of interventions and the cost of scaling up in the studied communities. The project will also build capacity in the science of early childhood development for frontline workers, researchers and leaders in policy and practice. This includes establishing a sustainable research and policy platform to share programs and practices globally, translating evidence into policy, and enabling expansion, replication and scale-up of effective interventions on the national, regional, and global levels. It will also strengthen the North-South partnership between two key institutions, the Aga Khan University and the Sinai Health System, to establish a well-recognized centre of excellence with the organizational and intellectual capacity to advance a more global science of early human development.The Nairobi project will be co-led by Aga Khan University's Institute of Human Development and the Sinai Health System.

This project supports the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry (hRHR). This network is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and then back to communities in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan. Given the high number of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address the different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. More specifically, the project will analyze existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use, develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization, strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men, and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes, develop a dashboard of data and related analysis, assess the quality, timeliness, and reliability of data, and build the capacities of researchers and decision-makers. The main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and inter-operability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.  This project represents one of nine spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems). The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada's new Feminist International Assistance Policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development.

These risks are especially challenging for poor rural women and children, who suffer even more from hunger, food insecurity, and a lack of adequate health services. Since these risks differ across agro-ecosystems in the country, it is crucial that adaptation measures recognize the value of targeted, location-specific, community-based strategies and processes. Community-based adaptation approaches have been tested in the Philippines for the past three years and are currently being mainstreamed via national government processes. This project builds on lessons from these methodological, institutional, and model-building research efforts leveraging the linkages between agriculture, climate change, and nutrition. The goal of this project is to identify and scale optimal climate-smart agriculture practices and interventions suitable for the four major agro-ecological regions of Myanmar: the central dry zone, the mountain uplands, the upland-plateau, and the delta. Using participatory research methods, the study, implemented by the New York City-based International Institute for Rural Reconstruction, will assess a portfolio of low-cost technologies and interventions in selected locations that serve as Climate Smart Villages. Towards the end of the project, scalable models will lead to guidelines for promoting a number of proven approaches that farmers can select for their specific agro-ecological zones.",Agricultural policy and administrative management,Yes,0.6687371134758

2018181632,F.a: Kishapu Climate Change Adaptation Programme,F.A: KISHAPU CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PROGRAMME,"The Kishapu area is one of the poorest of Tanzania. A challenge is the shortage of potable water. The situation has deteriorated as the local climate becomes drier. Reasons are increased firewood usage due to population increase, and traditional farming methods. This has transformed the area into semi-desert in many places. Chemicals harmful to health have polluted ground water. A new challenge is rainfall unpredictability brought about by climate change, which weakens food security. The project, part of the TCRS village community empowerment program, supports the population in the area in adapting to the change in their habitat and in prevention of desertification. Expected long-term effects: members of village communities within project sphere of influence actively participate in the development of their villages taking into consideration environmental impacts. Results of activities (i) improved status of women and girls, youth, hiv-positive and disbled individuals, (ii) improved availability of clean drinking water, (iii) functioning hygiene and sanitary solutions in schools and homes, (iv)  members of village communities in project villages participate in decision making and development of their communities with regard to environmental impacts, (v) behaviour of households is modified to be more environmentally friendly, (vi) transparent, responsible, and democratic leadership in project villages. The Kishapu project area covers 14 villages, and the education project includes 8 313 beneficiaries (3039W, 1671M, 2091G, 1512B, including 213 disabled individuals) and 504 (139W, 365M) bearers of responsibility. Additionaly there are 31 613 indirect beneficiaries. The target groups are children and youth in danger of becoming marginalized, disabled people, women, girls, victims of financial, sexual, and physical abuse, civil servants, political decision makers, and key individuals of organizations. The project is implemented by Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS). Their area of expertise includes the problems of refugees and those living in extreme poverty and human rights based approach in village communities. They activate villagers to act as they accumulate knowledge and skills. Administrative competence of the organization is strong, and professional skills of its employees is high.

Under a new core policy action, SSC completed a comprehensive analysis of a strategic development and sector road map for 2010 to 2020 to address market infrastructure bottlenecks for capital market growth. To address accounting standards, the government initiated a gap assessment to more closely align Vietnamese accounting standards with the IAS and developed an implementation timeline. To enhance market information standards, the draft Law on Independent Audit was submitted to the government. To enhance information disclosure, the Vietnam Securities Depository (VSD) completed the pilot implementation of the automatic synchronization of records between its head office and branches for public companies registered with VSD. To strengthen VSD s risk management capacity, a risk assessment of its central depository and clearing functions benchmarked against international practices will be undertaken. Output 2: Strengthened institutional framework for securities issuance. To develop the government securities market, the program supports institutional reforms such as the establishment of Public Debt Management Office (PDMO). Together with the Banking and Financial Institutions Department of MOF, PDMO will provide an institutional focal point to support a range of key reforms in the bond markets. To improve the risk management and the operating efficiency of the money market, and open market operations for the development of a liquid secondary market, SBV will incorporate the short-term risk mitigation measures identified in the ADB TA report.

The main beneficiaries are 3600 women in the districts of Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha and Jamalpur even if a substantially larger number of people, including these women's children, will benefit, to various extents, from the positive effects of this project.SWAPNO-II aims to increase the targeted women's income and assets by expanding their choices, enhance their capabilities for exercising choices, strengthen their resilience to shocks, including disasters and climate change, and enhance their financial inclusion and ensure that the benefits are sustainable over time.This will be achieved through a combination of efforts. The women will first be engaged in public-works to rehabilitate and/or climate proof critical local infrastructure for which they receive a small, predictable, fortnightly, salary during a period of six months. A part of the remuneration is set aside in compulsory savings which the women will access as a lump-sum at the end of the public-works period to allow them to, for example start their own small-scale businesses. They will also be trained in various life-skills as well as skills relevant for future employments, enhancing their networks and contributing to personal dignity. Assistance will also be provided to access digital financial services and insurance schemes. The idea is that their increased income combined with life and employability skills and enhance self-esteem will help beneficiaries invest productively to ensure a stream of income in years to come.

Description: Undernutrition is a major consequence of climate change. Biodiversity could enhance climate change resilience of local food systems by improving human nutritional outcomes and providing healthy local food resources during/after climate-related risks. What is unclear, however, is how food biodiversity (FBD) is linked to human nutritional status. This study aims to answer that question by investigating impacts of FBD on the prevalence of malnutrition-related anemia in Shawi Indigenous adults aged 15 to 60 years old and assess the role of FBD on the resilience of Shawi to extreme floods in past five years. This will be achieved through two complementary studies. In the first study, Shawi people who have experienced recent floods will have FBD measured using questionnaires and 24-hour recall. Anemia will be assessed using a novel, non-invasive, image-based application alongside measuring blood hemoglobin. Given that seasonal changes could affect FBD, a cross sectional study with repeated measurements will be conducted to explore if the association between FBD and anemia is stable at different times of year. In the second study, community-based participatory approaches will be used with Shawi participants to investigate the role of FBD on responding to extreme floods Key words: nutrition, biodiversity, Amazonia, resilience, Indigenous people",Basic nutrition,Review,0.421971946954727

Summary: Almost a quarter of the people in Liberia live in the slums of Monrovia, with very poor housing, poor water supply, and very little sanitation. The 2014 Ebola outbreak destroyed many lives and many people lost their jobs and sources of income. This project aims to help slum dwellers organise themselves. They will be assisted to document their living conditions, and the findings will help influence wider government policy on slums. These groups will be assisted to start savings schemes, and these will be used to help them start small businesses The project will also set up a Community Fund which will enable slum dwellers to make improvements in their houses and their living conditions. Big Lottery Fund funded 78 percent of this grant but the whole amount is attributed to Comic Relief as no double-counting occurs.

2018008976,Addressing climate- and water-driven migration and conflict interlinkages to build Community Resilience in the Congo Basin,ADDRESSING CLIMATE- AND WATER-DRIVEN MIGRATION AND CONFLICT INTERLINKAGES TO BUILD COMMUNITY RESILIENCE IN THE CONGO BASIN,"The Congo Basin holds approximately 40% of African water discharge and is critical to continental and local water security. Adverse effects of climate change, including changes in seasonal rainfall and increased frequency and intensity of floods, landslides, and soil erosion are amplifying the vulnerabilities of the Basin's 120 million people, who are reliant on rain-fed agriculture. This is especially true for women, who account for more than 73% of the people who derive their livelihoods from agriculture and who produce more than 80% of the region's food crops. There is also speculation that climate change leads to or exacerbates conflicts within the Congo Basin due to increased pressure on resources. The usual human mobility trends have recently been replaced by new patterns of pastoralist migration from northern regions to access the basin's arable land, pasture, and water resources, resulting in new kinds of conflicts. These interlinked challenges threaten livelihoods, increase competition, intensify divisions and ethnic tension, reduce state capability and legitimacy, and trigger poorly designed climate action. Empirical research to obtain up-to-date hydro-climatic and socioeconomic information is needed to address climate and water-driven migration, conflict interlinkages, and their implications for the basin's population.  This project will involve quantitative and qualitative research and training activities for key stakeholders in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The field research will target communities of pastoralists, farmers, fishers, Indigenous peoples and migrants. The project activities will guide the identification and assessment of gender-specific climate adaptation and conflict resolution strategies such as water preservation, water use sharing, access to potable water, income generation, food security, and livelihoods. This is expected to directly benefit an estimated 600 people, of which approximately 60% are women. The project is expected to contribute to the implementation of the DRC's National Strategic Plan for Development that was adopted in 2017 and calls for protection of the environment, access to water and sanitation, and adaptation to climate change for a better quality of life.",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.383118212223053

Higher temperatures, frequent droughts and increasingly heavy rainfall are aggravating the ongoing food insecurity (76% in 2016/17), poverty (76%), stunting (27%), and degradation of agricultural, forest and pasture ecosystems in the more arid Agro-Ecological Regions (AERs) III, IV and V in particular. Nowhere is this more evident than in the vulnerability  hot-spots  of Buhera (Manicaland Province), Gutu (Masvingo Province) and Bulilima (Matabeleland Province) districts. Failure to adapt to climate change may cause the rural sector and smallholder farmers to fall further behind in terms of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Climate Adaptation for Rural Livelihoods (CARL) in Zimbabwe project's Theory of Change is premised on the belief that the capacity of rural households to absorb, adapt or transform in the face of increasing climate risk can be improved if there are changes in their access to a combination of livelihood assets at household (micro), watershed (meso) and national (macro) levels. The goal of the CARL project is to improve the well-being of Zimbabwe's rural population and reduce poverty and food insecurity in the face of climate change. The underlying project development objective is to improve the climate resilience of agricultural production and rural livelihoods for 6,000 households in Buhera, Gutu and Bulilima Districts of Zimbabwe. This will be achieved through three interrelated outcomes, (i). Targeted vulnerable communities increase adoption of climate resilient livelihoods and agricultural production systems, (ii). Rural women and youth in targeted vulnerable districts increase their income and economic power in sustainable agriculture value chains, and (iii). Support institutions have strengthened technical capacities to address mitigation and adaptation concerns of rural livelihoods.The CARL project will use Climate Resilient Villages and associated micro-watersheds as entry points to combine the scaling up of existing successful practices with innovations and new pilots in areas where needed. The scaling up will be achieved by leveraging financing from government, farmers, the private sector (including the financial sector) and other development partners that share Oxfam's ambition to reduce rural poverty through increased climate resilience and productivity.BeneficiariesThe project will directly benefit 6,000 households (25,200 women, men, youth and children) from 16 wards in Buhera (6 wards), Gutu (5 wards) and Bulilima (5 wards) districts. Of these, the project will deliberately target 1500 women (500 from each district) and 300 youths (20 from 15 wards. In Bulilima only 4 wards will be targeted since youths there tend to be too mobile) for enterprise development to support some of the resilience building interventions.

Three wells, which already exists in the town were constructed in 1980 and since the town had only a half of its current population, their production was sufficiet. Nowadays the two out of three wells are very old and the third does not function at all. The two functioning well are able to provide potable water at maximum for half of the town's poppulation and their can operate only when there is an elecricity in public grid - which works approx. 6 - 9 hours per day. Becuase of the previous armed conflict, which officialy ended only in December 2017, neither the local government nor the town itself does not have a funds for the (re)construction of the wells. The realization of the project forsee the construction of three new wellls and the reconstruction of one old, which does not function. Two wells will be connected to the already existing water tank which already provide the potable wated to the town water distribution network. Another two wells will be also connected to the new water tank which will be constructed by another project and subsequently it will be connected to the town water distribution grid. The project will therefore exclude the lack of the potable water which in combination with the high temperatures, which in this region of Iraq reach even 50 °C, present serious danger for life of local inhabitants and also a high risk for contangious deseases caused by a low hygiene. Moreover the sufficciency of the potable water will support the local inhabitants in the cattle breeding and the agriculture, which will reinforce the cohesion between the local original inhabitants and the IDPs families.",Basic drinking water supply,Review,0.313906729221344

The document will encompass primarily the environmental strategies and action plans for the FBiH, RS and BD, but also actions needed to be implemented at BiH level (e.g. horizontal issues and follow-up of BiH ESAP). The BiH ESAP will be a strategy that will identify in a bottom-up way shared strategic environmental goals and principles for BiH, as well as thematic goals and targets, and feasible measures and activities from all three administrative levels aligned to the sub-themes of the EU environmental acquis. The BiH ESAP will include cost estimates of proposed measures and activities to reach the strategic goals at BiH, entity, and district levels, which will guide prioritisation of domestic and international investments. This strategic document will thus provide a long-term planning framework, allowing for best practices and actions to be more consistent across the country, facilitate monitoring and reporting of the set goals and targets, as well as to monitor progress of the EU approximation process.The expected long-term impacts of this Project is to improve the state of the environment in BiH and progress in the process of BiH approximation to the EU.

Project: 11762 Enhancing livelihoods and access to the labor market opportunities for Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians#2. Project area and Country: Jordan (Amman and Mafraq Governorates) #3. Project justification: #The youth unemployment rate in Jordan is exceptionally high, nearly a third of the Jordanian youth aged 15-24 is out of work, which is double the international average. The problem is particularly severe for young women. In the past few years, the situation has been further complicated by the influx of Syrian refugees who compete especially for unskilled jobs and often have to settle for lower salaries. At the same time, public sector jobs that constitute more than 60 % of formal employment in Jordan, can employ only a limited number of local youth and remain inaccessible to the new-comers. As a result of the multitude of problems, the right to work and the right to an adequate standard of living by the Jordanian youth and the Syrian refugee youth remain unmet. Given the limited absorption capacity of the public sector, as well as its inaccessibility to the refugee population, it is now necessary to look into the private sector for effective solutions to address youth unemployment.#4. The main objective and the expected results:#The main objective of the project is the improved socio-economic status and resilience of Syrian refugees in Jordan as well as their host communities. This will be promoted through enhanced market-oriented vocational skills and capacities of the targeted marginalized people including women and PWDs, provision of start-up business opportunities for rights-holders with feasible and innovative project ideas and improved coordination and awareness on enterprise promotion and socio-economic development at national and regional level.#5.

La pacífica situación política y su estratégica geolocalización, fronteriza con Zambia, Mozambique y Tanzania, hacen que, pese a las duras condiciones y bajos niveles de desarrollo socioeconómico, Malawi acoja, a día de hoy, aproximadamente a 40.000 refugiados y demandantes de asilo, la mayoría provenientes de áreas en conflicto en la región de los Grandes Lagos de África central, así como de Somalia y Etiopía.

Simultáneamente, España, potencia colonizadora del Sahara Occidental, abandona el Territorio. El Pueblo Saharaui, por ello, se ve obligado a huir hasta cruzar la frontera de Argelia, país que les presta apoyo, acogiéndoles y permitiéndoles vivir en ?la Hamada?, zona del desierto argelino llamada así por lo inhóspito del su paisaje y la aridez de su terreno. En 1976 los saharauis proclaman la República Árabe Saharaui Democrática (RASD). Así, mientras los hombres en el Frente libran una guerra por la liberación de su Territorio, las mujeres son las encargadas de establecer, organizar, gestionar y mantener los actuales Campamentos de Población Refugiada, donde se asientan. En el año 1991, se firma el ?Alto el Fuego? auspiciado por la ONU. Desde entonces, han pasado más de 42 años y el Pueblo Saharaui refugiado continúa en los Campamentos de Tinduf (Argelia), cuya población asciende a +/- 174.000 personas, dependiendo por completo, para su supervivencia, de la Ayuda Internacional.Objetivos previstos:1-La formación del personal sanitario local y la asistencia a la población, a través del trabajo de una Comisión Sanitaria de esta entidad: Equipo de Atención Primaria y un Equipo de Especialistas en Salud Mental.2-El mantenimiento de los Hospitales de Aaiun y Tifariti.

The emphasis on urban development in Rajasthan, financial reforms and the passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act in 1992, which laid the basis for decentralization in the urban sector, have made some improvements, but large inefficiencies in service delivery, low investment in wider service coverage, and poor maintenance persist.

More than 8 million Syrians currently live abroad (more than 1 million in Europe). Today, prospects for a swift, safe and voluntary return to Syria as well as for a safe space for civil society within Syria are rapidly fading, forcing civil society actors to rethink their engagement as a civil society in exile. Thus, they see and voice the need to (i) become better organized in their host countries and to (ii) seek collaboration between civil society organizations (CSO) in Syria's neighboring countries and the CSO in Europe in order to get their voices heard and contribute to a better future for Syrians inside and outside Syria. Europe is currently the safest space for dialogue for the Syrian CSO and Diaspora as well as a key location for advocacy towards the UN, EU, and EU's member states, making it a fertile hub for those organizations. The present project aims at supporting Syrian-led activities in Europe by (i) fostering cooperation between Syrian CSO and Diaspora networks in Europe and (ii) empowering Syrian umbrella organizations in Europe to start dialogues for Syrians in the Diaspora on their role in their host country and towards Syria.

Ethiopia, with Uganda, is hosting the largest number of registered refugee population in Africa. The project will target both South Sudanese refugees and host communities living in the areas surrounding the camps. South Sudanese refugees have been placed in Gambella Region, located in the South West of the country and bordering South Sudan, against a local population totalling some 310,000 people, of whom approximately 45% are Nuer and 22% Anuak, Gambella hosts more than 350,000 South Sudanese refugees, most of them Nuer, placed in 7 camps. Literacy level is exceptionally low among the South Sudanese, the average literacy rate being 27% (female literacy rate is 16%, and male 40%). This is reflected in UNHCR data from the camps in Gambella, according to which more than 70% of the whole South Sudanese refugee population is uneducated. Similarly, illiteracy is very high also among the local population in Gambela, reaching 54% in the population of 15  60 year olds (40% among males and 66% females). Since the majority of the population in Gambella is Nuer as South Sudanese refugees, FRC intervention on functional literacy will target equally refugees and host communities. The objective of the project is that through an inclusive approach, refugees and host communities in Ethiopia have enhanced their capacity to anticipate, manage, and recover from shocks (resilience) and their mutual relationship (social cohesion) has improved. The outcome of the project is that adult South Sudanese refugees in camps and host communities living nearby are empowered by the acquisition of functional literacy and life skills.

Along with other donors, Canada's contribution seeks to cover the additional costs of providing formal education for Syrian children, thereby protecting the futures of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable refugee girls and boys. As with all pooled-fund projects, Canada is working in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Jordan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems, increase donor coordination and harmonization, and strengthen mutual accountability. This project also fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, which helps to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors. This is one of two parts (project numbers D003790001 and D003790003) of the Scaling Up Access to Formal Education for Syrian Girls and Boys project, which has a total budget of $16 million. / Ce projet aide le ministère de l'Éducation de la Jordanie à mettre en œuvre son engagement historique, qui consiste à s'assurer que chaque enfant de la Jordanie suit une éducation formelle, peu importe sa nationalité. En plus de celles d'autres donateurs, la contribution du Canada couvrira les frais supplémentaires liés à la prestation d'un enseignement scolaire formel aux enfants syriens, protégeant ainsi l'avenir de centaines de milliers de jeunes réfugiés vulnérables. Comme c'est le cas pour tous les projets de fonds commun, le Canada travaille en étroite collaboration avec d'autres bailleurs de fonds et le gouvernement de la Jordanie pour favoriser la responsabilisation, la transparence et l'efficacité des systèmes nationaux, accroître la coordination et l'harmonisation entre les donateurs et renforcer la responsabilité mutuelle. Ce projet favorise également un plus grand dialogue sur les politiques parmi les donateurs, le gouvernement et les partenaires, ce qui contribue à renforcer les efforts déployés pour fournir une aide ciblée et efficace et obtenir des résultats de développement à long terme.

The refugee situation in Kenya is protracted with more than 90% of refugees having lived all their lives in camps. The refugee status is not a permanent solution for refugees. Durable solutions - as globally understood - comprise of local integration in the host country, voluntary repatriation in the country of origin or resettlement to a third state. The number of Somali refugees being repatriated is significantly low, largely due to the pervasive insecurity in Somalia. Moreover, there are dwindling resettlement opportunities because many countries are increasingly unwilling to accept refugees for political reasons. One of the main avenues in which refugees can access local integration is through naturalization and/or acquisition of work permits. However, due to unfavorable policies which are related to the government linking refugee hosting to terrorism incidents and the general insecurity in Kenya as well as the pervasive hurdles for naturalization and access to work permits, the prospect of actualizing durable solutions through local integration in Kenya remains diminished. The linkage of hosting refugees to insecurity has led to xenophobic attitudes within the Kenyan society towards refugees and a range of abuses meted on refugees by security agents, including arbitrary arrests, extortion, torture and deportation.",Human rights,Review,0.159798145294189

2019217221,Mitigating bat viruses: from forecasting spillover to control at the source,MITIGATING BAT VIRUSES: FROM FORECASTING SPILLOVER TO CONTROL AT THE SOURCE,"Programme: Senior Research Fellowship. Description: Bats are among the most important sources of emerging viral threats, responsible for Ebola, SARS and Nipah. We currently mitigate the impacts of bat viruses reactively, by treating humans or domestic animals after viruses emerge and cause disease. This fellowship proposes that deeper understanding of viral epidemiology, combined with new statistical and biological tools, could empower a strategic shift towards prevention. Using a tractable and important bat virus, vampire bat-transmitted rabies, I will first use routinely-collected surveillance data to develop models that rapidly forecast spatiotemporal emergence risk as epidemiological situations change, enabling use of life-saving human and animal vaccines prior to outbreaks. Next, field studies, experiments and viral genomics will allow individual-to-landscape epidemiological models to identify sensitive points in viral transmission cycles that could be exploited by interventions. Finally, I will explore whether revolutionary new approaches to vaccinology using self-spreading vaccines can reduce human and livestock mortality by controlling bat viruses at their source. This research delivers immediate translational benefits by mitigating health and economic costs from the most important bat virus in the Americas, strengthens international research capacity, and creates a biological and methodological toolbox to manage pathogens in bats, an historically intractable reservoir of zoonotic viruses.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.138590395450592

Many countries show trends towards globalization of migration, that is, more countries are affected more profoundly by significant flows of migration to and from an increasing variety of destinations and origins. African migration is to a great extent intra-continental even if there has been an acceleration and spatial diversification of emigration out of Africa since the late 1980's. African migration is often seen as being essentially driven by poverty, violent conflicts and underdevelopment, increasing migration seems rather to be driven by processes of development and social transformation, which have increased the capability and aspirations to migrate, a trend which is likely to continue.The international community is increasingly acknowledging that migrants can make a positive contribution to development, both in countries of origin and destination. Migration has postive effects on poverty reduction via remittances that contribute to savings, investment, the well-being of persons, improved resilience, and the creation of jobs and services. Immigrants have much to contribute to to development although there are factors such as poor integration and underemployment that could undermine their contribution. Data on immigrants could help to create policies that maximize the contribution of migrants to development.The implementation of standardized approaches to collect, process and utilize labour migration relevant data is therefore a priority of this project. In that regard, the project will support the respective African Union Commission (AUC), REC Commissions and member states to promote harmonised methodologies for labour migration data, including supporting the appropriation and use by member states of international standards, methodologies and compatible operating procedures for migration data collection and analysis. On the basis of improving national data sets the project also foresees the compilation of regional data sets providing overviews of labour migration and employment data and trends in the respective REC sub-regions. Use of several forms of data sets is anticipated to strengthen data collection on labour migration. These include field studies using multi-site areas, special studies, administration record systems, national census, population and household surveys, and longitudinal surveys.Hence, this contribution is aiming at supporting Statistics Sweden to achive the following:- To improve the availability of data and analysis on migration and labour statistics at the RECs and improve institutional capacity where the capacity is low,- To enable RECs to harmonize and  incorporate migration, remittances and related issues into the standard households surveys at the member states level,- To enable the RECs to regularly avail the data and analysis on migration, remittances from migrants and the refugee situation in the regions and enable member st",Statistical capacity building,Review,0.126807734370232

WLP's mission is to transform power relations and promote justice, equality, peace, and sustainable development by strengthening the feminist movement. This is done through curriculum and resource development, training, capacity development, advocacy and movement building while promoting and sustaining leadership that is participatory and replicable. WLP's overall objective is to empower women to become active citizens and effective participatory leaders and to build communities of shared values of social and political change to achieve legal equality, economic justice, security and political participation through advocacy and movement building. Sida has funded WLP with core support from 2015. Through curriculum development, training, civil society strengthening, women's human rights advocacy and movement building, WLP has expanded partners' international, regional, and local leadership, raised public awareness on democracy and women's rights, strengthened democratic development and political participation by training more than 22,000 emerging leaders, and achieved commendable results through partners' advocacy and activism. WLP submitted an application to Sida for core support of 36 000 000 SEK for a four-year time-frame (2018-2022) on 27 March, 2018. The intervention will focus on capacity development of its partners, women and girls through training programs, produce and promote feminist research from the Global South, participate in and support women's organisations' advocacy and networking activities, preserve women's movement history though documentation of the women's movement, and expand WLP's international outreach for long-term sustainability. Additionally, WLP will expand its program in four new directions in response to external factors shaping the rights of women globally: i) empowering refugee women, ii) reforming family law, iii) promoting human security, and iv) strengthening the capacity of women's civil society organisations.The intervention's total budget for 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2022 is approximately 90 000 000 SEK, out of which WLP has secured funding of approximately 5 870 000 SEK (663 000 USD). Several of WLP's donors provide short term support which is expected to be renewed on a yearly basis. The support from Sida accounts for approximately 40% of the organization's total budget during the 4 year intervention period.","Women's rights organisations and movements, and government institutions",Review,0.0889574959874153

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to affect indirectly 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education). It is part of Senegal's National Child Protection Strategy (SNPE - 2013–2018) and the Program for Improvements to Quality, Equity and Transparency in Education (PAQUET – 2013–2025).As with all program-based approaches, Canada works in close co-operation with other donors and the Senegalese government to promote the accountability, transparency and effectiveness of national systems, to increase donor coordination and harmonization, and to strengthen mutual accountability. The program-based approach also favours greater policy dialogue among donors, the government and partners. This helps to strengthen efforts to obtain focused and effective aid, as well as long-term development results. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of this project is undertaken in coordination with other donors. / Ce projet vise à améliorer le bien-être des enfants de huit régions du Sénégal (Matam, Sédhiou, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Kolda, Kédougou, Tambacounda et Ziguinchor) et à offrir aux enfants, dans le cadre de leur scolarisation, une protection adéquate pour leur permettre de vivre et d'étudier dans des structures qui leur garantissent la sécurité et leur donnent toutes les opportunités de réussite possibles.

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to affect indirectly 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.This project is one of the three components of the Strengthening Support for Child Protection in Education in Senegal project, valued overall at $20M and jointly implemented by Plan Canada, UNICEF and the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Senegal (through the Ministry of Education). It is part of Senegal's National Child Protection Strategy (SNPE - 2013–2018) and the Program for Improvements to Quality, Equity and Transparency in Education (PAQUET – 2013–2025).As with all program-based approaches, Canada works in close co-operation with other donors and the Senegalese government to promote the accountability, transparency and effectiveness of national systems, to increase donor coordination and harmonization, and to strengthen mutual accountability. The program-based approach also favours greater policy dialogue among donors, the government and partners. This helps to strengthen efforts to obtain focused and effective aid, as well as long-term development results. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of this project is undertaken in coordination with other donors. / Ce projet vise à améliorer le bien-être des enfants de huit régions du Sénégal (Matam, Sédhiou, Kaolack, Kaffrine, Kolda, Kédougou, Tambacounda et Ziguinchor) et à offrir aux enfants, dans le cadre de leur scolarisation, une protection adéquate pour leur permettre de vivre et d'étudier dans des structures qui leur garantissent la sécurité et leur donnent toutes les opportunités de réussite possibles.

2018002043,Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project,URBAN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERY PROJECT,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) is one of the largest public-private partnerships (PPP) in the delivery of primary health care (PHC) in South Asia. The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005. The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012. A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II. With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states). Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030. According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.

2018002043,Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project,URBAN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES DELIVERY PROJECT,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) supported Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP) is one of the largest public-private partnerships (PPP) in the delivery of primary health care (PHC) in South Asia. The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005. The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012. A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II. With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states). Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030. According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population. Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas.

Se benefician 190 personas.Todas las mujeres han llegado a El Líbano huyendo de la guerra, después de perder a sus maridos y otros familiares cercanos. Viven con la condición de refugiadas, que otorga el ACNUR1-Esta condición les permite estar en el país pero no les dan opción a trabajar, por lo que las condiciones de vida son muy duras. Todas dependen de la Ayuda Humanitaria. Los hombres refugiados consiguen trabajo más fácilmente en las labores del campo, pero la condición de la mujer es todavía más complicada. A esto se unen los abusos sistemáticos que sufren las mujeres solas refugiadas en El Líbano (ver informe que adjuntamos de amnistía internacional), tanto a nivel social como laboral.Actualmente viven en una casa cedida por un ciudadano libanes en las afueras de la ciudad.

Project: 12091 Improving employment and livelihood opportunities for Somali and   youth through TVET and business skills development    2. Project area and Country: Hargeisa, Somaliland3. Project justification: Somaliland is one of the poorest nations in the world. About 60% of Somalilanders are youth aged 15-35 years old, among those 40% are aged 15-29. The overall adult literacy rate across Somaliland is of 45.3% (50.2% among men and 40.2 among women). The unemployment rate in Somaliland among youth aged 14-29 is 67%, one of the highest rate in the world, with women experiencing higher unemployment rate at 74% than men at 61%. The majority of the employment is classified as vulnerable employment with low wages, low level of social security, poor working conditions, and limited worker rights, with women experiencing more vulnerability than men do. Poor to no level of education leaves the vast majority of youth with little opportunity to access the labour market, rendering them without hope and perspective. 4. The main objective and the expected results:The project aims to contribute to sustainable and profitable employment and self-employment opportunities for male and female youth from IDPs, host communities and returnees in Hargeisa of Somaliland. The aim is going to be achieved by following FCA's thematic pillars of right to livelihood (R2L) and right to quality education (R2QE).

2018181483,F.a: Building strong and resilient local trade unions in the Malawi tea supply chain,F.A: BUILDING STRONG AND RESILIENT LOCAL TRADE UNIONS IN THE MALAWI TEA SUPPLY CHAIN,"Malawi is Africa's second largest tea producer, after Kenya. The tea industry is the largest formal sector employer in Malawi, employing more than 50,000 workers. The purchasing power of the CBA remains far from a living wage. Negotiation between the workers and the national tea producers' association has proved a challenge for the workers, as the trade union is struggling to maintain the 15 % minimum threshold required to grant them bargaining rights. One reason for low union membership is short term contracts. In many tea estates joint consultative committees are preferred over trade union membership as they don't have a membership fee. This has translated into inactive plantation level trade unions and shop stewards. Workers low productivity don't support trade union's demands for wage increase. Significant number of women work in the tea sector, and they face several gender-based challenges like GBV, low job security in case of pregnancy and weak opportunities for managerial positions. The issue of harsh treatment and harassment by capitaos and the difficulties involved in raising these issues is an important driver of vulnerability, especially for unskilled women labourers. The US Department of Labor recognizes the use of forced labour and/or child labour in the tea industry in Malawi. Elderly people, people with disabilities and people with HIV/AIDS have an even higher vulnerability to low wages, as they tend to be the first to lose their jobs during economic hardships. Malawi is also really vulnerable for climate change and has experienced series of heavy rains, landslides and flooding.The rightsholders of the project are 6,400 workers in 2 tea plantations in Malawi, of which 23 per cent are women. The goal of the project is to ensure right to a sustainable livelihood for worker households in tea sector in Malawi. The purpose of the project is improved terms, conditions and rights at work. The expected outputs of the project are: 1) Strengthened trade union capacity to represent workers, 2) improved worker welfare in tea estates, 3) Improved worker productivity, 4) Improved resilience and adaptation to climate change and environmental degradation by tea estates, 5) Improved gender equality, 6) Increased work opportunities for people with disabilities in tea estates.The project is implemented by Fairtrade Africa in cooperation with the trade union PAWU, Tea Association of Malawi (TAML) and Oxfam. http://www.fairtradeafrica.net/",Employment creation,Review,0.0575331710278988

The aimed long term impact is to improve the health of the population. WASH (water- sanitation and hygiene) sector is important in poverty reduction. In the water and sanitation sector the global policy direction is formulated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development which includes the targets for rural WASH as SDG 6.1 and 6.2. The project is based on the CMP model (Community Managed Project Approach): the communities are themselves in charge of the construction management and maintenance of thier water points. In the course of Phase IV the CMP model will be developed further to be modified towards higher technologies (deep wells water supply) largely triggered by the need to adapt to climate change especially droughts. CoWASH IV will continue in the same regions selected during Phase III: Oromia Tigray SNNPR Benichangul Gumuz and Amhara. The first phase of CoWASH project started in 2011. Since then the project has managed to build 15000 water points enabling access to clean water for 31 million rural people. Safe water supply and sanitation facilities has been provided for 967 schools and 419 health facilities. In phase IV the targeted number of people having new or re-habilitated/upgraded safe water supply is 800000. The aim is to increase the percentage of households using latrines from the current 42% up to 62%. Institutional WASH is targeted to schools and health facilities and the objective is to provide new safely managed water supply systems to 100 schools and health centres.

It primarily aims at supporting the overall vision of UNDP's Strategic Plan 2018-2021:  to help countries achieve sustainable development by eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development and build resilience to crises and shocks . This will be made possible by providing support for the programmes's two building blocks: 1) About 80 % in support of specific UNDP-implemented projects and initiatives in three selected program areas, aimed at strengthening both thematic work, as well as integration and synergies between the areas: (a) Sustainable management and use of ecosystems, biodiversity and natural capital, (b) Sustainable water and ocean governance and (c) Improved climate measures for sustainable development, as well as the nexus area of sustainable food systems where all programme areas are included, and2) About 20 % of the support towards strengthening the organisational capacity and performance of UNDP to facilitate the transition to more strategic, integrated and programmatic practices that tie together all the projects in the area of environment and climate change and a stronger learning that put together are expected to lead to improved and more transformative results at the country level. The aim is to contribute to a programmatic approach making the whole larger than the sum of all UNDP-implemented environment and climate change projects and decrease fragmentation.The contribution implies that all global support from Sida to UNDP in the area of environment and climate change will be collected under one umbrella programme, including the two on-going contributions within water and oceans (Water and Ocean Governance och Ocean Innovation Challenge). All the programme areas are relevant to the strategy for Sweden's global development cooperation on sustainable environment, sustainable climate and ocean, and sustainable use of natural resources 2018-2022. In addition, the programme is fully in line with the government's strategy for cooperation with UNDP 2017 - 2021 and above all that UNDP should develop its activities in climate change, ecosystems, resilience and environmentally sustainable communities.Between 5-10 pilot countries will be selected jointly by Sida and UNDP, focusing on the poorest countries, to carry out the activities under the Programme's two building blocks. UNDP has proposed a preliminary list of 11 countries based on a number of agreed criteria. Thes include, country demand for the support, that UNDP has a large project portfolio in the country -  NDC support including support from vertical funds, a strong focus on LDC's and Sida's partner countries and that at least one small island develop",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.0509676001966

Project area and Country: Kamwenge district, Uganda #3. Project justification: #In the Kamwenge district the poverty level at 77.8% is one of the highest in Uganda. The influx of Congolese refugees in Kamwenge has put significant pressure on social services in the district. The women in the project location areas (9 sub-counties) have the highest illiteracy rates (65%), work longer hours, produce most of the food consumed in households and are more vulnerable due to their limited access to cash income and resources such as land, which are largely controlled by men. Due to high illiteracy rates and lack of employment opportunities, women do not have the necessary incomes to address their and their familys needs and to break the vicious cycle of chronic poverty.  #4. The main objective and expected results:#The WINGS project will address the above-mentioned challenges and work with women, especially girls, from the nine sub-counties to increase their household income through savings and investment.#The main objective of the project is to reduce household poverty for 75% of the targeted women so that they can meet their basic needs and are food secure by end of 2019. This will be accomplished through enhanced capacities of the 4800 VSLA members to accumulate savings, the targeted girls and womens improved skills in agricultural practices and in business management and entrepreneurship, as well as increased participation of women and girls in decision making in the targeted villages.#5.

Also, the ongoing Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (SSW 2), which commenced in 2002 and is due to be completed in 2009. This has developed 275 subprojects in 61 of 64 districts of Bangladesh. The Project will support the development of inclusive water management cooperative associations (WMCAS) that include landowners, land operators, women, fishers, and other vulnerable groups. The WMCAS should have sufficient social and technical capital to undertake small-scale water resources (SSWR) subprojects and to improve system operations. They should have clear financing partnerships and/or cost-sharing mechanisms so they can carry out sustainable maintenance. Within an enabling institutional framework, they should be capable of maximizing their collective potential to increase agriculture production in the subproject areas. The Project will have three outputs: (i) institutional strengthening of government agencies at all levels to support SSWR development, (ii) participatory subprojects, which will include poor and vulnerable groups, and which will enable WMCAs to plan, implement, operate, and maintain subprojects, and (iii) construction and maintenance of up to 270 SSWR subprojects and performance enhancement of up to 150 subprojects (out of 560 completed) from SSW 1 and 2 projects.",Disaster Risk Reduction,Yes,0.040327750146389

For example, freshwater supply is diminished by droughts and affected by saline intrusion due to sea level rise and more intense storms. These impacts are further influenced by human demand for water that frequently surpasses the available supply, thus reducing the water available for proper ecosystem function. This research will investigate the interaction between human activity and ecosystem services, and consider how this affects water availability under projected climate change scenarios. The project will advance our understanding of how a changing climate affects the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts, along with water availability and use, including sanitation needs for vulnerable communities in small island states. Researchers will develop assessments of future climate change, water scarcity, and vulnerability in representative watersheds in three Caribbean countries - Barbados, Jamaica, and Trinidad. A combination of natural and social science research methods will be employed, such as climate modelling and downscaling, and an analysis of secondary census and economic data will be conducted. Results will be used to inform the development of national water resource adaptation strategies, building on the University of West Indies' work on climate change adaptation. The project will build the capacity of at least a dozen graduate students.

Despite this trend, there is little evidence about how these female-headed households fare on various indicators related to women and children's health and well-being. This includes indicators measuring reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health and nutrition, women's empowerment, and levels of birth registration for children under five, as well as birth certificate ownership. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will not be achieved without gender equality, and gender equality cannot be achieved without data equality. The absence of quality gender data and related analysis makes it difficult to track progress towards the SDGs and can lead to policymaking and service provision that is not informed by evidence. This project seeks to address this knowledge gap and strengthen gender analysis capacities across multiple regions in the Global South on the growing proportion of households headed by women. Working with existing data sets and drawing on the local research networks established by Countdown to 2030 (tracking progress in maternal, newborn, and child mortality), the project will examine trends of female-headed households over time and across regions, notably in Latin America and the Caribbean, eastern and southern Africa, West and Central Africa, and the Middle East and North Africa. The project, implemented in collaboration with the US Fund for UNICEF, will strengthen capacities across the different regions to conduct systematic statistical analyses, with a focus on gender and intersectional (multifactor) analysis, of over 350 national demographic and health surveys starting from the 1990s. These results will be disseminated through open-access journal articles, policy briefs, and advocacy materials, as well as in the 2020 Countdown Report. Moreover, the project will support masters and doctoral students, and develop post-graduate training that will be widely available. The results are expected to influence how data related to female-headed households is collected and analyzed.

This project seeks to understand the complexity of youth dissatisfaction and negative coping mechanisms, including radicalization and emigration, in Lebanon (including Syrian refugees) and Tunisia. Despite increasing youth dissatisfaction with the failure of Arab states to address the above issues, this project recognizes untapped youth potential and seeks to promote youth as agents of change, rather than objects awaiting resources and intervention. This project rests on two pillars. The first seeks to understand the challenges, problems, aspirations, inspirations, and perspectives of youth (including women) and then encourages them to engage with positive inspirational figures or role models from their countries. This will be conducted through focus groups, experimental surveys, and role-model workshops. The second analyzes the existing institutional policies that have an impact on youth. A task force process will be launched to discuss, develop, and promote policies that meet youth needs with the relevant government officials and civil society organizations. Through interviews, focus groups, workshops, regional meetings, and publications, including a policy book and policy recommendations, the project will provide new knowledge on what inspires and motivates youth and how role models have an impact on them.

The project is focusing on building  legal agency  for IDPs by increasing accountability and access to justice for violations of human rights with a focus on gender based violence (GBV) committed by the security forces.  It will build a skill set amongst IDPs to document and advocate on human rights violations against their community(ies), both at the national and international level. The project will work with Somali actors to create a cadre of human rights enablers within the IDP community itself and those that provide legal representation to them.  An independent Civilian Oversight Board (COB) over the Somali National Police Force will be established in areas containing the highest number of IDPs. The project will be commenced in Mogadishu and expanded in the southern and central regions of Somalia over three years. The intervention's total budget is 10 167 500 SEK (1 089 689 USD) , out of which approximately 1 million SEK is supposed to be contributed by another donor (discussions are ongoing with UN WOMEN).

This project implemented by Developmental Action without Borders (Naba?a) intends to contribute to the  reduction of early marriage in the most vulnerable and neglected communities (Lebanese and Syrian communities) in Akkar North Lebanon and providing a protective environment particularly for young and adolescent girls . This will be achieved through the followings two main components, 1.The first one is fostering and reshape the lives of the most marginalized  Lebanese and displaced  young and adolescent girls through empowering the vocational skills and enrolling them in the vocational training center to study a vocational profession this might help in preventing them to get married in the early ages and to think of their future in addition to provide an opportunity for the  displaced young girls to find a job in the Lebanese community and to integrate with into it so that their socio-economic situation will be enhanced as they are able to afford their daily expenses without being a burden on their families. 2. The second component will be focused on the parents adolescent girls and Community Members whom will be empowered and enabled to take Informed Decisions and to become Agents of Positive Change in order to prevent and Respond to Early Marriage. This will be achieved through (awareness raising capacity development for parents particularly mothers and community leaders on the child rights protection and the risks of early marriage).As a result of the project 20 adolescents' (15-18 years) socio-economic situation is improved through vocational and life skills trainings. Additional 600 family  and community members are empowered and become aware about early marriage and its impact on the girls  so that the community members can become agents of positive change in order to mitigate and respond to early marriage.",Human rights,Review,0.0235729329288006

The project is inspired by the concept of a Diwan (An Arabic word symbolizing an audience hall or  tent, where community members gather to socialize and resolve conflicts). This project targets women and youth, who have traditionally been left out of local decision-making processes, as well as various local leaders and governance actors. Project activities include: (1) providing training workshops, (2) organizing community roundtable discussions, (3) planning community projects, (4) supporting youth community centers, and (5) encouraging cross-municipality collaboration.This project involves 480 direct beneficiaries and 5,000 indirect beneficiaries. / Ce projet vise à contribuer à une gouvernance plus inclusive et participative dans les municipalités de la région de Wadi Khaled, dans le nord du Liban.Il  a pour but d'aider les dirigeants locaux et les membres de la communauté (résidents libanais et réfugiés syriens) à nouer des liens empreints de respect et à collaborer plus efficacement en vue de promouvoir la stabilité sociale. Le projet s'inspire du concept du « diwan » (mot arabe désignant une salle ou un lieu où les membres de la communauté socialisent et règlent des conflits). Ce projet vise les femmes et les jeunes, qui ont été traditionnellement ignorés dans les processus décisionnels, ainsi que divers dirigeants locaux et intervenants de la gouvernance. Parmi les activités du projet : 1) offrir des ateliers de formation, 2) organiser des tables rondes communautaires, 3) planifier des projets communautaires, 4) soutenir des centres communautaires pour jeunes, 5) encourager la collaboration entre les municipalités.Quatre cent quatre-vingts (480) bénéficiaires directs et 5 000 bénéficiaires indirects participent au projet.","Civilian peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution",Review,0.0225297678261995

In 2012, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam ranked among the top ten aquaculture producers globally. Thailand and Vietnam are the third- and fourth-largest exporters of fish and fishery products, valued at CA$10.6 billion and CA$8.3 billion respectively. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam all have national policies that aim to increase aquaculture production significantly. However, the region is facing a warmer future with more frequent and severe weather events and rising sea levels that impact regional hydrology. Mekong aquaculture is already affected by floods, causing fish loss from ponds, damaging cages, and exhausting fish trying to maintain their position in the current, while droughts and low water levels impact water quality, increasing toxicity and fish death. This project aims to help fish farmers in the region to manage climate-related risks and increase adaptive capacity by developing, evaluating, and supporting the uptake of promising innovations. The innovations include technologies such as wind- and solar-powered pond aerators, institutional and policy measures such as mutual or weather index-based insurance for risk transfer, and information-communication systems, including text messaging and Facebook groups. These will be piloted and adapted to different local contexts, and up-scaled across the five countries through a network of nationally based innovation specialists, each having a thematic project-wide coordinating role, and technical experts who will only work as needs arise.

To achieve these objectives, the project intends to launch virtuous economic circles through the creation of synergies between agro-pastoral and commercial production sectors.

PROMOVIENDO EL DERECHO DE LAS MUJERES REFUGIADAS PALESTINAS DE LA FRANJA DE GAZA (Fase II) :: El proyecto se llevará a cabo en diferentes localidades de los cinco departamentos administrativos (governorates) en los que se divide la Franja de Gaza               La violencia de género que sufren las mujeres en la Franja de Gaza es estructural y se ve reforzada por la situación de ocupación, lo cual está teniendo un impacto negativo en la autoestima de las mujeres, en su salud física y psicológica así como en su vida familiar y en la de sus hijos e hijas.  Durante generaciones, la violencia contra las mujeres ha dividido familias y comunidades perjudicando el desarrollo social y económico al no contar con el capital humano que supone la mitad de la población y que ha desplazado de la participación pública a las mujeres con lo que ello supone.                  Para enfrentar esta situación se presenta la siguiente iniciativa, con la que se pretende mejorar las condiciones sociales y la atención integral para que las mujeres en la franja de Gaza puedan ejercer su derecho a vivir una vida libre de violencia de género. Para ello se van a desarrollar dos resultados con sus correspondientes actividades:           1. Reforzar la atención integral a mujeres de la franja de Gaza víctimas de violencia de género a través del Sistema de Derivación de Violencia de Género. Para ello se va a llevar a cabo un módulo formativo de dos semanas de duración dirigido a 23 terapeutas del Programa Comunitario de Salud Mental, se costeará el salario de 4 responsables de género de dicho programa durante 11 meses y se dará seguimiento a los servicios ofrecidos por el Sistema de Derivación de Violencia de Género.                2. Generar en la población de la Franja de Gaza mecanismos que permitan influir positivamente en el cambio de normas sociales causantes de la violencia de género. Para ello se trabajará con 10 organizaciones comunitarias que organizarán grupos de discusión con mujeres y sus hijas para debatir sobre cuestiones relacionadas con la violencia contra las mujeres. Estos mismos grupos organizarán en cada una de los cinco departamentos una iniciativa comunitaria de prevención de la violencia de género.

The disease hasn't been beaten yet but rather new problems emerge such as multi-drug resistant forms of TB resulting in much more complex treatment regimens and bigger danger to the population.LSV will continue to diagnose and treat TB patients in Hargeisa and Mogadishu. As a new strategy the private sector health care providers (clinics and pharmacies) and local communities will be engaged in the effort in a systematic way in order to strengthen a holistic public-private-people partnership approach to tackling the disease. In addition collaboration with the local maternity and child health facility network will be strengthened. The overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of TB burden and suffering in Somalia. The immediate objectives of the project include 1) To increase TB awareness and participation of communities in TB control. 2) To increase TB awareness and participation of private practitioners and pharmacists in TB control in. 3) To diagnose and treat patients at two TB centers according to WHO's DOTS protocol. 4) To provide TB culture services and drug susceptibility tests (DST) for suspected MDR cases.Regarding the cross-cutting themes the project will empower women and facilitate their access to TB services. In addition the project will reduce inequality by providing an access to TB services for internally displaced persons (IDPs).

20190090761,Improving Agricultural Productivity and Resilience with Satellite and Cellphone Imagery to Scale Climate-Smart Crop Insurance (Cultiaf-2),IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND RESILIENCE WITH SATELLITE AND CELLPHONE IMAGERY TO SCALE CLIMATE-SMART CROP INSURANCE (CULTIAF-2),"The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.  This project is funded through the second phase of the Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF-2), a joint program of IDRC and the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

Description: India is home to more than half the global population at risk of cholera. While cholera is significantly under-reported, there is recognition that sanitation and water interventions alone are insufficient to control disease in highly endemic areas, with significant environmental reservoirs and, during disasters and population displacements. Affordable killed oral cholera vaccines are available, but in limited quantities. A novel single strain whole cell killed oral cholera vaccine (Hillchol) has been developed by Hilleman Laboratories and evaluated for immunogenicity in a phase I/II clinical study. The further testing of this vaccine for efficacy is likely to be challenging for several reasons, including the need for large field trials, and the complexity of regulatory processes when a licensed cholera vaccine is available in India. A cholera human infection model, would permit evaluation of efficacy in adults in endemic areas, and would follow a pathway to licensure that has already resulted in one cholera vaccine (Vaxchora) being approved by the US FDA. The Christian Medical College, Vellore is already putting in place the infrastructure and processes for a human infection model of typhoid and will transfer the cholera model from Centre for Vaccine Development, Maryland, which was responsible for the Vaxchora study.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.0067552519030869

Vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change is remarkable. Threatened species such as tigers and snow leopards are threatened by poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Rural people are dependent on the natural resources for their daily needs to provide food, fodder, energy and water. Moreover, climate change has exacerbated the threats to biodiversity and peoples livelihoods. Theres also now window of opportunity to facilitate conservation mainstreaming in new federal structure.##Geographically programme focuses to the far-western parts of Nepal which belong under the Terai Arc Landscape. Programme aims to improve the forest corridor cover and connectivity as well as support buffer zone conservation and management through community-based conservation and cooperation with district forest officers. Improvement of the livelihoods and wellbeing of the local communities is gained through developing income generating activities such as forest-based enterprises and by increasing access to low carbon energy. In addition, we increase conservation awareness and empower local youth to act for the environment. We also support local communities to adapt in climate change by developing ecosystem based adaptation solutions. Programme tackles illegal wildlife trade and poaching by supporting community-based anti-poaching groups. ##Expected achievements by 2021# Around 3,000 ha of degraded forest is under improved management and restoration# Community forest groups and their members are capacitated and empowered to manage forests# Sustainable forest management plans are prepared and implemented for degraded forest area# At least 3 green community based enterprises are established and strengthened# 5,000 plus youth and children are made aware of conservation issues and challenges##Beneficiaries: the local community forest user groups, women and youth groups, ethnic minority groups, forest workers and disadvantaged groups, local governments.##Implementor: WWF Nepal (www.wwfnepal.org)",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.00663821259513497

The project proposal focuses on the Central region of the the Republic of Moldova and the town of Straseni. Only 15% of the population has access to the sewerage system (the national average is 30%). In Straseni (about 22 thousand inhabitants) access to the sewerage system is secured for only 61% of the population, which is little in the urban area. The town also does not have a waste water treatment plant. A poorly developed sewerage system is one of the factors that create unfavourable sanitation conditions and cause more frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases, and it is also a barrier to further socio-economic development. The project aims to support the development of waste water management in the Central region. The support will be built on three interconnected pillars: (1) support to the extension of infrastructure - the construction of a sewerage connection in the town of Straseni (2,640 m of newly built sewerage serving 1080 inhabitants/308 households), and the elaboration of a Feasibility Study and an Environmental Impact Assessment for the missing waste water treatment plant in Straseni, (2) capacity building of 12 urban water management operators (municipal enterprises) and 13 municipal authorities of the Central Region through the implementation of two expert workshops and two study vistis in Slovakia, (3) engagement of the public in the Central region and raising awareness about responsible approach to environment with emphasis on the proper management of household waste water. Education of the community will be delivered in form of an educational summer camp for 20 young people who, in addition to acquiring knowledge, will develop their own local community water management projects, and present their community.

The viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical regions, including many low-income countries. Most infected individuals recover, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years, and effects of outbreaks on working communities are devastating.Currently no antiviral therapies or vaccines have been approved for any alphavirus infection. In recent research, we showed that viral RNA replication is entirely dependent on interaction with the cellular protein G3BP. We propose to form a collaborative network to use structure-based methods to design compounds which would block viral interaction with G3BP, thus blocking replication of chikungunya virus and the others in the alphavirus group. We will test a number of compounds for antiviral activity, with the best performing compounds being used as templates to design improvements in a second generation of compounds. We will organise a number of meetings at each location and we will apply for further funds to expand our network in future years.Anti-alphaviral compounds would be of enormous benefit for global health, especially in regions of low or low-to-middle income. We hope that this collaboration network proposal will act as a seed for a very strong international network with the delivery of such a drug as our priority.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.00455125467851758

In relation to the strategy for Sweden's development cooperation with Rwanda 2015-2019, this is directly linked to increased access to services and support for improved opportunities to start and run commercial businesses, which is one of the result under the support area of  better opportunities and tools to enable poor people to improve their living conditions . The intervention strengthens the possibilities for access to capital specifically in the field of renewable energy, which also ties to the support area of  a better environment, limited climate change impact and greater resilience to environmental impact, climate change and natural disasters . It is explicitly stated in the strategy that  the business sector's work on green economic development and green innovations, including sustainable energy solutions and trade in green products and services, can help to limit negative environmental and climate impacts.  This intervention will increase the likelihood of a private sector investment focusing on sustainable energy solutions and green services and therefore be well aligned with the Swedish government strategy in this results area.A guarantee program in Rwanda addressing this sector would also enhance and support the development impact of ongoing and planned initiatives within the Swedish development cooperation with Rwanda. Primarily, the Energy for Impact (E4I) programme, aimed at scaling up renewable energy by supporting the private sector to deliver access to energy in rural areas, will be supported by this guarantee. Supporting the development of increased access to finance for clean energy is also a crosscutting enabler for sustainable economic development, human health, equitable growth and the resilience of poor and vulnerable communities. The guarantee is also relevant in relation to Sweden's current support to Access to Finance Rwanda (AFR) aiming to increase income and productive employment for the poor through increased access, and utilisation, of financial services. The intervention can therefor be viewed as strategic and catalytic for several results areas identified for the Swedish development cooperation with Rwanda. The guarantee is expected to enable financing to private actors focused on development of, and access to, renewable energy solutions. This through risk sharing with the financial institutions, which traditionally are cautious with lending to actors in the energy sector - a sector which is percieved as high risk. A guarantee is assessed as a cost efficient way of strenghtening achievement of development results in the strategy for Swed",Formal sector financial intermediaries,Review,0.00407570879906416

By controlling animal diseases, negative impact on economic development, food security and livelihoods can be mitigated. For many important animal diseases the epidemiology is well understood, but despite that, effective control is not achieved. It is becoming evident that to control diseases, sociocultural, economic and political dimensions are as important as veterinary knowledge.African swine fever (ASF), is a severe and fatal infectious disease of pigs, with great socio-economic impact on rural communities in Uganda. ASF has been known and studied for almost 100 years, but is still uncontrolled in most areas.Using multidisciplinary participatory methods, the project will investigate reasons for farmers' responses to disease, such as social pressures, poverty-related constraints, and lack of health and veterinary infrastructure. The feasibility of sustainable implementation of control interventions at all levels in the value chain will be investigated, and the effect of stakeholder participation on the processes evaluated.

Summary: Freetown slums are in a deplorable state with many areas devoid of piped water and any form of improved sanitation. Most houses are made of temporary building materials and settlements are vulnerable to flooding. Cholera is a recurrent hazard. Comic Relief funded a previous slum project (2008 2012) supporting communities in three slums to improve their quality of life. However, the need to make additional improvements within these settlements and to help others, still exists. This follow-on project intends to support young people, petty traders (particularly women) and other disadvantaged people living in 8 slums in Freetown. The project will provide vocational training and apprenticeships, affordable micro-credit loans and improvement of literacy, business and money management skills. It will also improve access to basic services, including water and improved drainage and provide hygiene training. The capacity of local community based organisations (CBOs) will be strengthened and support provided to improve advocacy skills, enhancing their ability to hold government to account. As a result there will be a healthier environment and increased incomes, especially for women, young people and other marginalised groups, leading to a better quality of life in the slums.

Description: The impacts of extreme heat events will increase with climate change and a rising urban population. Using an unprecedented urban resident mortality database for nine Latin American countries, we convene an interdisciplinary research team to examine: a) the impacts of climate change on urban population mortality from increases in the magnitude, duration, and frequency of extreme heat events, b) and the modifying effect of greenspace and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) on the association between heat events and mortality. We focus on two time periods: baseline (2001-2010) and midcentury (2051-2055). For the baseline we use past climate, mortality, greenspace, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> data to estimate associations and interactions of interest by age and education. For the midcentury, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to downscale aggressive and conservative IPCC global climate scenarios to a 36-km resolution and predict the duration, magnitude, and frequency of heat waves. Future population, greenspace, and PM<sub>2.5 </sub>scenarios, coupled with the predicted heat events and estimated coefficients, are used to project future excess mortality by age and education. This study will provide evidence of health impacts of a climate adaptation and mitigation strategy in the face of future heat waves and outline opportunities for pro-active involvement.",Health policy and administrative management,Review,0.00259360810741782

Description: On crossing the species barrier to humans from their natural rodent hosts, arenaviruses are responsible for widespread, severe and fatal viral haemorrhagic fevers. These diverse and emerging pathogens are endemic in South America and West Africa, where frequent seasonal epidemics are associated with fatality rates as high as 50%, due to the lack of vaccines, effective treatments and a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern arenavirus pathogenesis. Preliminary data demonstrate for the first time a synergistic restriction activity against arenavirus entry by two cellular host factors known for their control of enveloped virus infections. By combining virus entry assays, live virus assays, proteomic and biophysical analyses and my expertise in antiviral restriction mechanisms, this study will:Determine the susceptibility of arenavirus entry mechanisms to restriction and address the mechanisms arenaviruses may have evolved to subvert inhibition, and Characterise the biochemical and molecular nature of the interaction between the two host factors.This study will address questions about the role of host cell restriction factors against arenavirus entry and is the first step towards the long-term aim of developing novel therapeutic strategies to enhance innate immune responses to arenavirus infections.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.00257966225035489

Description: Early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) reduces transmission thus impacting TB incidence and prevalence. Research undertaken in developing countries shows that current TB diagnosis algorithms act as a barrier to poorer people seeking TB diagnosis and treatment. Patients accessing these services may incur catastrophic costs therefore hindering the achievement of WHO s target of 0% incidence of catastrophic costs due to TB. This has led to concerted efforts to develop interventions that simplify TB diagnosis and treatment pathways. In Blantyre, Malawi, one such intervention based on computer-aided x-ray diagnosis (TB-CAD) is currently being investigated in the PROSPECT study, a randomised controlled trial. My research will investigate the public health benefits and cost-effectiveness, &ndash, from the health provider and societal perspective &ndash, of TB-CAD. By fitting statistical models using the PROSPECT study s trial data, I will estimate the long-term impact on TB prevalence, incidence and mortality in Malawi, assuming that TB-CAD were to be scaled-up at country-level. I will additionally estimate whether the health benefits and reduction in costs are equally distributed between the poorest and the least poor in society. These data will provide policymakers with evidence for whether TB-CAD offers a cost-effective and equitable approach to reversing TB epidemics in Malawi.",Tuberculosis control,Review,0.00228320038877428

We also will develop estimates of how weather and air pollution impact mortality in Brazil. Combining these works, we will calculate the health impacts of climate change for air pollution and weather, considering sensitive subpopulations. Further, we will consider sector analysis and impacts in the future to analyze &ldquo,co-benefits&rdquo, of short-term improvements in air quality under climate change policies. Our interdisciplinary team includes expertise in epidemiology, environmental engineering, biostatistics, exposure assessment, and atmospheric science.

Financial inclusion and financial stability are two closely interrelated concepts that both links to the financing for development agenda and the SDG targets. The G-20 has also highlighted the importance of both financial inclusion (Maya Declaration and the global partnership for financial integration) and the strengthening of financial stability (Council for financial stability (Financial Stability Board)), Basel III implementation and other regulatory reforms). At the global level, Sida supports a number of programmes that focus on financial integration but only a few focus on financial stability. Toronto Center and Sida's technical assistance programs with Sweden's Riksbank are two examples. Both of these two have an emphasis on capacity-building of government institutions of all central banks and its features.The IMF's Fund differs from these in that the capacity building the Fund is carrying out has direct links with the IMF's two other main mandates of surveillance and lending and is based on a holistic approach throughout the financial sector. FSSF's connection to the IMF's entirety creates an added value, of course, that there is a direct link to the management of financial crises and resistance to reduce the occurrence of crises, mitigate the impact of these.   The program is based on two main modules: -Module for financial sector statistics that help to provide decision makers with the statistical basis for the analysis of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial sector as well as the interconnection between sectors of the economy and the rest of the world.  -Module for financial sector reforms that will establish diagnostic baseline revisions, highlighting key weaknesses in the financial systems and institutional capacity as well as establish a prioritized action plan for financial sector reforms.       Similar to all IMF capacity development programs, the program is demand-driven, implemented by experienced internal experts and based on the IMF's long history of global commitment in this area. Genuine ownership is a prerequisite to be effective and achieve long-term sustainable results.

While there is no direct correlation between the income level and the possibility of being infected by the dengue virus, the economic impact on the poor is much larger since the funds spent by households below the poverty-line for the treatment of dengue amounts to 93.7% of their monthly per capita income even though free health care is available in Sri Lanka.The main vectors species of the Dengue and Zika viruses are mosquitoes that breed in very slow-flowing or standing water pools. It is important to reduce and control such breeding grounds to contain the spread of the diseases. We propose to use drones, unmanned micro aerial vehicles (UAV), to locate mosquito breeding grounds. UAVs equipped with cameras, accelerometers and other sensors can provide close-range aerial-inspection-capabilities. Using drones is a low-cost and hence sustainable solution. The main scientific challenges are to conceive visual-based, active sensing functionality to allow drones autonomously locate the relevant sites with little to no human intervention. Further, drones must be enabled to maneuver in confined areas to carry out the required tasks in built-up urban environments. Lastly, we must adaptively coordinate the operation of multiple drones to balance the application load among available resources, particularly with respect to the limited battery lifetime.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.00195261102635413

Description: Most individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain healthy, while a subset only progress to active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Early local immune events following infection in humans, determining the pattern of ensuing host immunity and risk of disease progression, are unknown. We defined a blood transcriptional signature of active TB, absent in the majority of latently exposed asymptomatic individuals and healthy controls, that reflected the extent of radiographic lung disease. I recently demonstrated immunological heterogeneity in the blood transcriptome of a cohort of recent TB contacts. A small proportion expressed a persistent TB signature and subsequently progressed to active TB disease, whereas 50% of contacts who were sensitized to M. tuberculosis infection but did not progress to disease, exhibited a similar, but not identical, transient blood signature, suggesting early local immune responses are critical determinants of outcome from infection. I will now lead a study of TB contacts to detect changes in immune events in the airways early after TB exposure, comparing with TB patients, in a low TB burden setting.The findings I will generate on the local early response to M. tuberculosis infection are critical for developing novel approaches for effective TB control and prevention and the improvement of vaccines.",Tuberculosis control,Review,0.00188770249951631

2018290914,Avian influenza in Bangladesh: the role of wild waterfowl in disease transmission,AVIAN INFLUENZA IN BANGLADESH: THE ROLE OF WILD WATERFOWL IN DISEASE TRANSMISSION,"Avian influenza is a devastating disease for poultry caused by highly-pathogenic influenza A viruses. Since the emergence of H5N1 in 1999, this virus and later progeny viruses (such as H5N6, H5N8) have become endemic in parts of Asia, with  outbreaks in poultry and few, but highly lethal, infections in humans. Highly pathogenic viruses are related to low pathogenic viruses that circulate naturally among wild waterfowl, and it is evident that highly pathogenic viruses can be maintained in the wild bird reservoir. And important question to ask is to which extent the interface between migratory waterfowl and poultry contributes to disease persistence. We propose to combine movement ecology of waterfowl with disease epidemiology of avian influenza viruses to investigate transmission of a highly contagious and lethal poultry disease at the wildlife/domestic animal interface in rural areas of Bangladesh. Poultry, both ducks and chickens, is an essential product in agriculture in Bangladesh, for subsistence farmers and for the expanding poultry industry. Outbreaks are devastating for individual farmers, but also has ramifications for trade. We will use the development in animal tracking to generate individual-based movement data of birds, ranging from smaller movements during non-breeding times to long distance migrations. The resulting tracks will inform spatial-epidemiological models to quantify persistence/transmission of avian influenza viruses at regional and flyway scales.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.0015343859558925

It does so by tackling a question identified by the recent IPCC report as a crucial question, what produces conflict and violence in the face of environmental change? The proposed research therefore begins from the insight that environmental governance policies and programs are often a platform on which actors struggle over discourses, authority and responsibilities. More scientific scrutiny is required into how such struggles within policies and programs can erupt as flash points for conflict and violence, or alternatively, can open up pathways towards peace and reduced vulnerability. Drawing from the social sciences the program explores how climate change is linked to perceptions of and responses to those changes. The work focuses on changes in forest and water resources in 2 countries: Nepal and Kenya. The objectives are: 1. To better conceptualise the social-political processes through which changing forest and water resources become enrolled in crises of legitimacy, conflict and violence. To produce empirical evidence of how global environmental change manifests social-politically within two carefully selected countries on two continents: Asia (Nepal) and Africa (Kenya). 3. To generate insights into how governance mechanisms can be better designed to address environmental conflict and violence concerns in least developed countries.
