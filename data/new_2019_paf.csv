20190090761,Improving Agricultural Productivity and Resilience with Satellite and Cellphone Imagery to Scale Climate-Smart Crop Insurance (Cultiaf-2),IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND RESILIENCE WITH SATELLITE AND CELLPHONE IMAGERY TO SCALE CLIMATE-SMART CROP INSURANCE (CULTIAF-2),"The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.  This project is funded through the second phase of the Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF-2), a joint program of IDRC and the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. CultiAF supports research to achieve long-term food security in eastern and southern Africa.",Agricultural financial services,Yes,0.999882936477661

Additionally, the programme will aim to target a minimum of 800 000 individuals and communities particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climatic change. It must be noted that the ZRBF, with gender equality at the heart of its programming will aim to target a minimum of 400 000 women in its programming.The expected results for the ZRBF, with the funding available as per 2015, is to enhance food security and livelihood diversification strategies of targeted communities that increase resilience to recurrent stresses/shocks. More specifically the ZRBF is expected to: • Increase effective evidence based institutional, legislative and policy frameworks in place at national and sub-national levels for resilience • Increase the absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities to face shocks and the effects of climate change for approximately 800,000 people in vulnerable communities frequently exposed to multiple hazards in a total of estimated 20 of Zimbabwe's 59 rural districts. • Improved protection of household and community assets and decrease in annual economic losses due to effects of hazards and climate change • A crisis modifier that can provide early warning and early action to reduce the impact of climate induced shocks in place for the Fund. (With the new planned budget allocation, a substantial increase in the target number of beneficiaries is estimated. While it is planned that 10-25% of programmable funds will be allocated to this result area, final beneficiaries number will be subject to further needs assessment and also based on the nature of the shocks/crises and scope of the planned response.)",Rural development,Review,0.0198608189821243

Lebanese municipalities are the primary line of response to the Syrian refugee crisis despite being very under-resourced to provide the services they are expected to deliver. In host communities, many people rely on informal mechanisms to resolve conflict, and those with little social capital, such as women, youth, and refugees may avoid claiming their rights altogether, leaving grievances unaddressed.Project activities include: (1) strengthening the municipal police force, (2) developing an early warning and early response mechanism to monitor and respond to tensions in host communities, and (3) providing legal aid to vulnerable people, especially women. The project also promotes measures to increase the number of female municipal police officers and sensitize both the judicial and municipal police to issues of violence against women. / Ce projet vise à aider les autorités libanaises à fournir des services de sécurité et de justice de base dans les collectivités d'accueil.

Dans les collectivités d'accueil, de nombreuses personnes comptent sur des mécanismes informels pour résoudre des conflits, et ceux qui ont peu de capital social, comme les femmes, les jeunes et les réfugiés, renoncent souvent à réclamer faire valoir leurs droits, ce qui laisse leurs griefs non résolus.Les activités du projet comprennent les suivantes : 1) le renforcement des forces de police municipales, 2) la mise en place d'un mécanisme d'alerte et de réponse précoces pour surveiller les tensions dans les collectivités d'accueil et y remédier, 3) de l'aide juridique pour les personnes vulnérables, en particulier pour les femmes.

2019215628,The local immune response in the airways and blood of contacts early after TB exposure determines outcome,THE LOCAL IMMUNE RESPONSE IN THE AIRWAYS AND BLOOD OF CONTACTS EARLY AFTER TB EXPOSURE DETERMINES OUTCOME,"Programme: Investigator Award in Science. Description: Most individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remain healthy, while a subset only progress to active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Early local immune events following infection in humans, determining the pattern of ensuing host immunity and risk of disease progression, are unknown. We defined a blood transcriptional signature of active TB, absent in the majority of latently exposed asymptomatic individuals and healthy controls, that reflected the extent of radiographic lung disease. I recently demonstrated immunological heterogeneity in the blood transcriptome of a cohort of recent TB contacts. A small proportion expressed a persistent TB signature and subsequently progressed to active TB disease, whereas 50% of contacts who were sensitized to M. tuberculosis infection but did not progress to disease, exhibited a similar, but not identical, transient blood signature, suggesting early local immune responses are critical determinants of outcome from infection. I will now lead a study of TB contacts to detect changes in immune events in the airways early after TB exposure, comparing with TB patients, in a low TB burden setting.The findings I will generate on the local early response to M. tuberculosis infection are critical for developing novel approaches for effective TB control and prevention and the improvement of vaccines.",Tuberculosis control,Review,0.000117813651741017
