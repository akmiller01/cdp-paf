Improving Agricultural Productivity and Resilience with Satellite and Cellphone Imagery to Scale Climate-Smart Crop Insurance (Cultiaf-2),IMPROVING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY AND RESILIENCE WITH SATELLITE AND CELLPHONE IMAGERY TO SCALE CLIMATE-SMART CROP INSURANCE (CULTIAF-2),"The livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers across the developing world are under threat from extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves. Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture.   Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture.   The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars.   This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.    This project is funded through the second phase of the Cultivate Africa's Future Fund (CultiAF-2), a joint program of IDRC and the Australian International Food Security Research Centre of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research.

Satellite data for Weather Index Insurance-AgricuLtural EaRly warning system (SatWIN-ALERT),SATELLITE DATA FOR WEATHER INDEX INSURANCE-AGRICULTURAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (SATWIN-ALERT),"For the more than 200 million farmers in Africa who depend on rain-fed agriculture, drought is a matter of life and death. Their vulnerability is often aggravated by a lack of access to risk management tools such as insurance, which also limits their ability to take productive risks on their farms. Index insurance, where compensation is based on weather or area yield metrics, rather than on measured losses, is an affordable alternative to traditional insurance. However, index insurance will only increase resilience to climate shocks if the index insured fairly reflects the risk for both farmers and insurers.   Index design processes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, utilizing multiple data-sources and models. A certain degree of basis risk (where compensation doesn't match observed losses) is, however, inevitable as insurance is not designed to target every risk. Anticipating basis risk that ensues from the complexity in the relationship between meteorological drought (rainfall deficit) and agricultural drought (soil moisture deficit) is a key challenge for the agricultural insurance sector.   We propose a new system, SatWIN-ALERT, which can be deployed in real time to detect and predict basis risk events as they happen. As such, it could unlock in-season actions (such as increased monitoring), or allow timely post-season index assessment or action, enabling aid agencies and governments to anticipate basis risk events, and take action to support farmers who are facing uncompensated agricultural losses. In effect, the facility to predict pay outs and losses bridges the gap between post hoc index insurance and forecast-based finance. SatWIN-ALERT provides a means of combining the data issued by existing platforms into integrated assessments of droughts and subsequent compensation. As such, it can be integrated into well-established and trusted insurance design systems, such as the ARC risk viewer (ARV) or the IRI Social Network for Index Insurance Design (SNIID).   SatWIN-ALERT builds on existing state-of-the-art practices to take a sophisticated approach to basis risk management, allowing index insurance to play an improved role within climate risk management and development. We also bring together novel existing participatory and meteorological research to build systems that are suitable for operational use in ODA countries. To do this, we draw on fundamental research on monitoring of environmental conditions, and on recent improvements in forecasts - especially on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales, working with established partners to bring results to hundreds of thousands of farmers. We will focus on countries identified as important to our partners, specifically Malawi for our participatory research, plus Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Zambia and Ethiopia (amongst others) for our basis risk case studies.  In summary, the proposed project will develop a novel operational system (SatWIN-ALERT), which empowers farmers to benefit from robust",Yes,0.999840378761292
Investigating the feasibility of municipal risk pooling as an adaptation finance measure,INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY OF MUNICIPAL RISK POOLING AS AN ADAPTATION FINANCE MEASURE,"Climate change-related insurance products have been commonly used to manage the risks from climate hazards over the last few years. However, traditional insurance has not been effective for low-frequency, high-severity events. Insurance can also be a costly solution because premiums are usually inflated above the expected losses to guard against the payment of claims in the event of large or multiple disasters. Moreover, insurance requires post-disaster economic loss assessments, which can delay the mobilization of relief funds and their distribution to households in need. For that reason, in recent years risk pooling has been considered as a potential financial instrument.   Risk pooling is a risk transfer instrument similar to traditional insurance, however, schemes consist of several individual risk holders who wish to aggregate their risks. Some risk pooling facilities are now operating, such as the African Risk Capacity and Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility. However, these risk pools face various barriers to country participation, including compromised sovereignty in terms of decision-making related to types of hazards covered and payout use, and an unwillingness to use domestic budgets for the benefit of other countries. A municipal risk pooling (MRP) facility is considered more appropriate, as it can avoid issues of compromised sovereignty.  Using the Western Cape province of South Africa as a case study, this project aims to assess the feasibility of a risk pooling facility at the municipal level targeted at managing flood risk. Project outputs include the flood event database of the Western Cape government, municipal risk profiles reports, peer-reviewed publications on topics related to municipal risk assessment and financing instruments, and a large network of insurance and reinsurance companies (interested in municipal risk pooling) to set the platform for a possible pilot supplemented by the findings of the prefeasibility study and scaling up. The main outcome of the research would be a pilot municipal risk pooling facility taken up by selected municipal governments for implementation. To ensure that the findings of this MRP are applicable in other contexts, the research will also develop a guidance framework outlining requirements and methodologies for MRP implementation. The development of a municipal risk pooling scheme would be the first of its kind and avoids barriers that have been experienced in sovereign risk pools.",Yes,0.999834895133972

A Collaborative Multi-agency Platform for Building Resilient Communities,A COLLABORATIVE MULTI-AGENCY PLATFORM FOR BUILDING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES,"There is significant evidence of the growth of natural disasters on a global level. The Asia-Pacific region continues to be the world's most disaster prone region, it has many low-/middle-income countries and accounted for 47% of the world's 344 disasters in 2015 with 16,046 fatalities and reported economic damage in the region of US$ 5.1 Billion. In this context, the most disaster-prone sub-region is South Asia, recording 52 disasters and 14,647 deaths, representing 64% of the global fatalities, in 2015.   Scientific research has shown that disaster risks do not only exist because of the presence of a physical hazard, they are compounded by the presence of vulnerability. Therefore, there is an urgent need to shift our focus from pure emergency response and recovery towards a sustainable disaster mitigation framework that focuses on building resilience within a disaster prone area, involving government agencies and the local community to reduce the impact of a hazard. However, at present there is a lack of tools and methods available to agencies to enable them to come together to understand the underlying vulnerabilities of a disaster prone area and build resilience to reduce disaster impact on a community.   Digital technology has the potential for creating a collaboration environment for various agencies and communities to act collectively to reduce the impact of disasters. The goal of this project is to develop a Collaborative Multi-agency Platform that can be used for building resilient communities in disaster prone areas in low-/middle-income countries. The project will focus on the challenges faced by three countries: Malaysia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. These countries are frequently affected by a multitude of natural hazards including floods, landslides, cyclones, droughts, and earthquakes and have therefore been chosen as the focus for this research to capture broader set of disaster conditions and requirements common to low-/middle-income countries.   The project aims to address the following research questions: What is the nature of a resilience framework that will allow low-/middle-income countries to assess their vulnerabilities and resilience capabilities and take measures to build resilient communities? How can we enhance multi-agency collaboration within low-/middle-income countries? What changes are required in terms of technology, organizational structures and collaboration processes to enhance multi-agency collaboration? What are the characteristics of a collaboration platform that can support collective vulnerability assessment and reduction by multi-agencies? How can we establish a system dynamic model that can support the simulation of cascading effect on critical infrastructure systems due to a hazard? How can we construct a collaborative 3D environment based on near real-time 3D satellite data and analysis for supporting early response and damage assessment after a major disaster? In addressing itself to these questions, the",Review,0.123390682041645

FAO s new strategic framework 2022-2030 places the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the centre of its operations. In terms of programme priority areas related to humanitarian interventions, FAO will focus on agriculture and food emergencies in countries facing, or at risk of acute food insecurity, by providing urgent livelihood and nutrition assistance. The strategic framework states that by 2023 FAO aims to assist 60 million people annually with emergency and resilience interventions, and through investments in anticipatory action that will reduce humanitarian needs in the future. This is an ambitious increase from the 35 million target in 2019. The focus on both acute food security and livelihoods with positive spill-over effects on household and community resilience in combination with FAO's leading technical expertise in agriculture and its focus on Anticipatory Action, makes FAO a valuable strategic humanitarian partner to Sida.Sida will in 2022 allocate 124 million SEK to FAO's emergency interventions in six countries: Afghanistan, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Madagascar and Somalia.

Open Network for WAter-Related Diseases (ONWARD),OPEN NETWORK FOR WATER-RELATED DISEASES (ONWARD),"The ONWARD Network (Open Network for Water-Related Diseases) is dedicated to forecasting, early warning & risk mapping for water-associated diseases through use of remote sensing, field observations & mathematical modelling. Our vision is to enable cost-effective, regularly updated, geo-referenced early warning for areas vulnerable to water-associated diseases, which in turn will enable preventive measures to be deployed in a timely manner to minimise the probability of epidemics. Our long-term vision is to establish a system that will be applicable broadly, in a variety of localities & for a variety of diseases. By 'water-associated' disease, we mean a rather broad class, including diarrhoeal diseases such as cholera, skin diseases associated with water-borne bacteria or metazoan parasites, vector-borne diseases such as malaria & dengue fever, & others such as hepatitis. The 'water' involved may be fresh, or brackish or coastal seawater. The network will respond primarily the GCRF Challenge of Global Health (infectious diseases), & secondarily to that of Resilience to Environmental Shocks & Change (since outbreaks of water-associated diseases are affected by extreme weather events, expected to become more frequent as a result of climate change). The network will also address UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, Target 3d, to 'Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing countries, for early warning, risk reduction & management of national & global health risks.' According to the World Health Organisation, some two billion people use faecally-contaminated drinking water, putting them at risk of death or chronic poor health from water-borne infectious diseases such as cholera, dysentery, typhoid & polio. Provision of safe drinking water is hostage to the influence of extreme weather & flooding. Apart from the fatalities, the effect of a chronic burden of lower-level infection by water-associated diseases is antagonistic to the maintenance of a healthy work force & to the well-being of society in general, to the detriment of sustainable development. For example, cholera kills an estimated 95,000 people every year, but it also makes another 2.9 million seriously ill with a debilitating disease. Hence the need to address, in addition, the resilience of communities to perturbations of the safe drinking water supply under extreme weather events associated with a changing climate. Before now, our ability to develop early warning, risk reduction & management of national & global health risks due to water-associated diseases has been limited by mutual isolation of the scientific communities whose collective effort is required to make progress. Forecasting outbreaks of water-associated diseases & their geo-referenced risk mapping is a complex matter for which the collaboration of experts from several disciplines (ranging from environmental biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, social sciences & epidemiology to remote sensing & mode",Review,0.0168373193591833

Improving the resilience of informal settlements to fire (IRIS-Fire),IMPROVING THE RESILIENCE OF INFORMAL SETTLEMENTS TO FIRE (IRIS-FIRE),"This high-impact project is concerned with how an interdisciplinary approach to fire science and engineering can improve the resilience of informal settlements against fires. Through a combination of state-of-the-art experimental and modeling fire science coupled with unique data gathering in informal settlements and novel applications of existing satellite data, we will deliver a framework to assess fire risk in informal settlements and propose technologically appropriate, data driven risk reduction methodologies. Over one billion people across the globe live in informal shack settlements, and this number is ever increasing as urbanization increases. Many of these informal settlements are at constant risk of lethal and large scale fires, due to flammable construction materials, heating and cooking methods, proximity of the shacks, and a lack of effective fire services, amongst other factors. For occupants of these shacks, death and injury from fire constitute 'a serious public health problem', 96% of the world's burn-related deaths (about 300,000 deaths annually) occur in lower- and middle-income countries.   Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent at 7% average increase between 1990-2015 and the population in urban clusters has increased by 484 million people in 25 years. In South Africa it is estimated that up to one third of the population now live in informal settlements, and in Cape Town the number of informal dwellings grew from around 28,000 in 1993 to 104,000 in 2006. Cape Town is known as the fire capital of South Africa and between 1990 and 2004 the Mandisa GIS database tracked over 18,500 fire incidents recorded, 47% occurred in informal settlements. On an annual basis there are around 500 deaths and 15,000 fire related hospital related admissions due to fire in the city, of which a substantial proportion are people from informal settlements. The project will develop the new methods and tools required to evaluate and model the fire risks within South African informal settlements of the Western Cape so that situationally appropriate and cost-effective solutions and strategies can be suggested to improve the resilience of South African informal settlement communities against large-scale conflagrations. This will be achieved through producing new guidelines, based on unique experimental data generated in the UK and in South Africa, surveying of Western Cape informal settlements to improve stochastic data on their composition and topography, probabilistic modelling of informal settlements based on validated models using experimental data, and important engagement and consultation with the stakeholders within informal settlements (NGOs, fire services, policy makers and local residents) to ensure that any new guidelines are appropriate and effective.  Additionally, a framework for risk mapping and monitoring, based on results of experiments and modelling within this project, will direct and inform where interventions using the guidelines",Review,0.0069708158262074

[Philippines] Catchment susceptibility to hydrometeorological events: sediment flux and geomorphic change as drivers of flood risk in the Philippines,[PHILIPPINES] CATCHMENT SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL EVENTS: SEDIMENT FLUX AND GEOMORPHIC CHANGE AS DRIVERS OF FLOOD RISK IN THE PHILIPPINES,"River morphology results from sediment transport and sedimentation, which are both a consequence of water flow. Episodic variation in natural (e.g. typhoons, earthquakes, volcanoes) and anthropogenic (e.g. gravel mining, river bank protection) sediment supply drives changes in riverbed levels and sedimentology. These changes determine channel capacity and flow routing, and thus associated flood risk to people and property. The same factors determine variations in lateral bank erosion rates, elevated rates result in the loss of developed floodplain and the failure of critical infrastructure such as road bridges. Despite the significance of variation in riverbed levels and channel position for flood risk, geomorphological processes are commonly overlooked in flood risk mapping. In the Philippines, rivers are particularly dynamic, risks arising from sedimentation and erosion need to be assessed and incorporated into flood risk management to mitigate the impact of flooding on welfare and the economy.   This project aims to: (i) develop a national-scale catchment characteristics database, and associated river geometry relations, to assess the susceptibility of different catchments to morphological change impacts on flood hazard, and (ii) assess flood hazards arising from morphological change associated with variations in sediment supply and the influence of lateral constraints on channel morphological adjustment. To achieve the first aim we will use national scale topographic models and repeat satellite imagery to assess fluvial and landscape characteristics to identify indicators of enhanced channel mobility and sediment transport, with outputs available from a river centreline Geographic Information System with data points every 1 km along the Philippines river network. This national scale dataset will be used by project partners to assess and plan infrastructure developments. To achieve the second aim we will generate repeat, high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the Pinacanauan de Ilagan River and the Bacarra Rivers, from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and bathymetric surveys. We will difference these DEMs to map patterns of erosion and deposition during a wet season, and calculate a sediment budget for each river. The DEMs and sediment budget will then be used to parameterise and assess hydro- and morpho-dynamic models that will be used to investigate changes in flood risk due to morphological change. This framework will be used, by project partners, to guide river and flood management in the Pinacanauan de Ilagan and the Bacarra catchments. The framework will also be transferable to other rivers in the Philippines, and farther afield in SE Asia and beyond.  This proposal forges a partnership between the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, the University of Glasgow, four Filipino project partners, and project partner Prof Brierley (University of Auckland). Specifically, the Philippine project partners are: the M",Review,0.00130290060769767

Promotion of an innovative and green slope protection system (GreenPro),PROMOTION OF AN INNOVATIVE AND GREEN SLOPE PROTECTION SYSTEM (GREENPRO),"Number and intensity of natural disasters have been increasing in mountainous countries like Nepal and Austria. In a developing country like Nepal, the intensity of natural disasters are even more due to weakly monitored infrastructure  development activities such as constructions of roads, buildings irrigation channels, telecommunication towers, hydropower projects etc. Almost every family living on hills and mountains is vulnerable to landslide, flood, debris flow and  earthquake induced landslides disasters. Due to increasing number of landslides incidents every year, it has become routine or customary to bear the loss of hundreds of lives and property worth millions of dollars due to landslides and  floods. In order to mitigate the human induced and rainfall triggered natural disasters, it is necessary to implement appropriate preventive and curative measures against slope failure, soil erosion and flooding. Soil nailing is an economical  and efficient reinforcement technique used as a remedial measure in unstable natural slopes or as retraining structure for excavated slopes. In comparison with other retaining protection structures, soil nailing permits to reduce the  excavated fill soil volume, saving construction materials and realization time. There are basically two concerns about the application of soil nailing, first is in its analysis and design and second is about the use of materials. In order to  make an innovative construction practice and to make it more cost effective, environment friendly and sustainable, a right choice of facing and an appropriate design of soil nails are very important. Regarding the analysis and design of soil  nails, several national codes or guidelines exist. But the role of facing elements in controlling the deformation of excavated front or the overall stability of slope is not yet completely understood (Sanvitale et al, 2013).The stiffness of  facing strongly influences the characteristics of tensile force distribution, such as for a slope of two lateral segments, the tensile force at the connection (nail head) of nail with facing, and the location of maximum traction on the  soil-nail-facing system. (Sanvitale et al, 2013). Most of the conventional soil nailing with shotcrete, precast concrete or metal facing elements are generally costly and do not offer a 'Green' slope. The flexible facing elements do offer  some possibilities to grow some plants on the slope but have some disadvantages e.g. bulging or punching at nail heads and are not suitable to control surface erosion and local shear failure. In the above context, the soil nailing system with  semi-flexible 3-dimensional galvanized steel mat (popular as KRISMERÂ® system in Europe) is a high-quality construction system which has proved itself one of the best solutions to stabilize slopes and embankments. Although, the functioning of  soil nailing with semi flexible 3D mat has been verified by different experiments and real site assessments, the act",Review,0.000929995672777295

URBE Latam: Understanding Risks and Building Enhanced Capabilities in Latin American cities,URBE LATAM: UNDERSTANDING RISKS AND BUILDING ENHANCED CAPABILITIES IN LATIN AMERICAN CITIES,"URBE Latam addresses the implementation gap between sustainable development and equitable resilience. It will do so by using a transdisciplinary research approach aimed at empowering residents of disaster-prone urban poor neighbourhoods, which will underpin the co-production of enhanced, context-specific understandings of local risks and the integration of the resulting data into decision-making procedures in disaster risk reduction and sustainable development monitoring.   The project is conducted by a highly skilled multi-disciplinary research team (including social sciences, engineering and physical sciences) and adopts a dialogic co-production approach to citizen-generated data which relies upon well-established partnerships with community-based initiatives for local development, education and disaster risk reduction in Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, as well as with governmental agencies involved in disaster risk reduction and local planning and development.  URBE Latam proceeds in four integrated components that seek an enhanced understanding of risks, vulnerabilities and local capabilities in disaster-prone urban areas: first it is centred on the engagement of citizens to generate data to expand understandings of risks at the neighbourhood level, second, citizens engagement in risk will be pursued alongside an analysis of socio-spatial inequalities in resilience and development indicators and policies at city and national level, third, this will lead to the recalibration of environmental risk mapping with citizen-generated data, fourth, these components are articulated and integrated within a framework to facilitate dialogic transformations across the different levels and stakeholders involved.  The process of advancing these outputs will further enable capacity development in local communities and the governments of Rio de Janeiro and Medellin, a process which will be augmented by improving the awareness of stakeholders in other Latin American cities and countries through broader dissemination.  Insights from collaboratively produced citizen-generated data will be integrated into the practices of disaster risk management and development monitoring (e.g. SDG reporting) in collaboration with international policymaking agencies, thus enabling transformations towards more equitable disaster risk reduction and sustainable development. As an overarching outcome, the project will enable the transformation of practices, improve knowledge among a diverse range of stakeholders and enhance capacity to promote equitable resilience.",Review,0.000577683618757874

Lebanese municipalities are the primary line of response to the Syrian refugee crisis despite being very under-resourced to provide the services they are expected to deliver. In host communities, many people rely on informal mechanisms to resolve conflict, and those with little social capital, such as women, youth, and refugees may avoid claiming their rights altogether, leaving grievances unaddressed.Project activities include: (1) strengthening the municipal police force, (2) developing an early warning and early response mechanism to monitor and respond to tensions in host communities, and (3) providing legal aid to vulnerable people, especially women. The project also promotes measures to increase the number of female municipal police officers and sensitize both the judicial and municipal police to issues of violence against women. / Ce projet vise Ã  aider les autoritÃ©s libanaises Ã  fournir des services de sÃ©curitÃ© et de justice de base dans les collectivitÃ©s d'accueil. Les municipalitÃ©s libanaises sont la principale ligne de rÃ©ponse Ã  la crise des rÃ©fugiÃ©s syriens, malgrÃ© le fait qu'elles manquent de ressources pour fournir les services qu'ils devraient fournir. Dans les collectivitÃ©s d'accueil, de nombreuses personnes comptent sur des mÃ©canismes informels pour rÃ©soudre des conflits, et ceux qui ont peu de capital social, comme les femmes, les jeunes et les rÃ©fugiÃ©s, renoncent souvent Ã  rÃ©clamer faire valoir leurs droits, ce qui laisse leurs griefs non rÃ©solus.Les activitÃ©s du projet comprennent les suivantes : 1) le renforcement des forces de police municipales, 2) la mise en place d'un mÃ©canisme d'alerte et de rÃ©ponse prÃ©coces pour surveiller les tensions dans les collectivitÃ©s d'accueil et y remÃ©dier, 3) de l'aide juridique pour les personnes vulnÃ©rables, en particulier pour les femmes.

Omics analysis of density-dependent disease resistance in a major crop pest,OMICS ANALYSIS OF DENSITY-DEPENDENT DISEASE RESISTANCE IN A MAJOR CROP PEST,"Pathogens are a ubiquitous threat to all living organisms, and a wide range of defense mechanisms have evolved to manage this threat. One way for an individual to prime its immune defense is to monitor the environment for cues of an infection threat and invest in immunity accordingly. The most obvious cue from the environment is previous exposure to pathogens. Nevertheless, exposure to a pathogen cue is itself dangerous to a potential host and a safer alternative is for individuals to respond to sensory cues that predict an elevated risk of infection before exposure. These are termed prophylactic or anticipatory defences. Reduced susceptibility to parasitic infection in individuals exposed to cues associated with high population density is known as Density-Dependent Prophylaxis (DDP), a putative adaptive response to the increased threat from parasites transmitted in a positively density-dependent manner. In the twenty years since the DDP phenomenon was first proposed, it has been characterised in a wide range of 20+ insect species, including Spodoptera caterpillars, but the molecular mechanism underpinning DDP has yet to be characterised, and this is the focus of my proposal.Spodoptera exempta is a major pest of cereal crops and pastureland throughout sub-Saharan Africa, causing serious food shortage. It expresses both phase polyphenism (different phenotypes expressed in different environments) and density-dependent prophylaxis, to a greater extent than any other lepidopteran insect. Spodoptera exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpexNPV) is a dsDNA baculovirus that is host-specific to S. exempta. I will use the Spodoptera-SpexNPV host-virus system, using a series of molecular and other methods, including RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, RNAi and pathogen biological analysis, to study the differential responses for *constitutively* expressed genes and pathogen resistance in solitary and gregarious larvae. To characterise differential responses for genes that are *induced* in response to baculovirus challenge and differential virus resistance in Ã¢â¬ËprimedÃ¢â¬â¢ solitary and gregarious larvae. Furthermore, the key immune genes underpinning density-dependent baculovirus resistance will be identified.The results of this study may provide a novel opportunity to manage a range of important lepidopteran crop pests.",Review,0.000332982133841142

Adoption of the 'fall cone' as the standard method of determining the index parameters and shear strength in South Africa,ADOPTION OF THE 'FALL CONE' AS THE STANDARD METHOD OF DETERMINING THE INDEX PARAMETERS AND SHEAR STRENGTH IN SOUTH AFRICA,"South Africa is classified as a third world country with a large population being under privileged. Consequently, the majority of the population depend on government to provide housing. Many of these houses have failed and continue to fail meeting expected life span. The problem is, to some extent, linked to improper foundation design due to location and soil type the houses are built on. With lack of regularisation of land tenure, the authorities are forced to offer plots on low lying areas which are dominated by shrinking-swelling clays - abundant in southern Africa - globally known as a major cause of damage to light engineering structures by exhibiting significant volume change in response to changes in soil water content. The calcareous nature of expansive clays in South Africa has also led to high spatial variability of physicomechanical properties, which has made the use of standard testing and design procedures challenging. Adoption of more reliable, rapid, inexpensive and bespoke testing methods â tripod partnership (industry, academia, and policy-makers) - will benefit from performance-based design and lower maintenance cost of buildings and critical infrastructures across South Africa. This project will expand the RAEng TASMIP technology that offered a reproducible consistency index parameter (liquid limit - LL) for highly variable expansive clays and silts. The aim is to verify the modified technology through testing on a wider range of samples from as many different regions of SA, before submission in form of a policy paper. Parallel work on determination of probability density functions for other engineering properties (e.g. undrained shear strength) will also be conducted. This should lead to full compliance with Eurocode 7 / BS EN 1997: Choose characteristic values for soil properties ensuring no more than a 5% probability of a limit state being reached because of the property under consideration.",Review,0.000100692210253328
