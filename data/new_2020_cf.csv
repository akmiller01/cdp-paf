Our preliminary observations and community engagement activities in two post-conflict societies - the Sub-Acholi Region in Northern Uganda and Northern/Eastern provinces in Sri Lanka, have demonstrated this to be an under-appreciated  complex and multi-faceted problem characterised by: a: Lack of suitable services capable of addressing the complex needs of the affected populations b:Inability of the affected population to access the existing services due to poor transport links, poverty and ignorance. c: Ad-hoc service development using non-sustainable funding sources at the time (or the immediate aftermath) of the conflict with inadequate characterisation of the needs of the local population. d: Social-cultural factors and belief systems that adversely affect the day-to-day experiences of the victims and prevent their reintegration into the society.  Influencing and engaging with future policy making in this field therefore requires an integrated approach involving multi-disciplinary teams.     This proposal aims to bring together the 'Humanitarian and Conflict Response Institute (HCRI)' - an institution specialising in global health and 'In Place of War (IPOW)'- an organisation with expertise in conducting cultural programmes in post conflict settings, to focus on the multi-faceted problem of disability associated with MLL in two post-conflict societies - Uganda and Sri Lanka. The project will link HCRI and IPOW with Gulu Medical Faculty (GMF)-established specifically to address the health needs of Northern Uganda, the 'Gulu Referral Orthopaedic Workshop (GROW)' - the only centre providing prosthetic limb services in Gulu district in Northern Uganda, and 'Meththa Foundation UK' (MF)-a charity that pioneered prosthetic services in post-war Sri Lanka using recycled components from the UK and an innovative outreach model for service delivery.

Humanitarian protection is often associated with particular situations of crisis. However, the vulnerability of specific individuals and groups is also rooted in enduring and multiple forms of conflict and violence. The Protection Network therefore starts with the recognition that there is a need to broaden our conceptual and empirical understanding of protection. In doing so, it examines the challenges of protecting vulnerable people from the perspective of those in need of protection rather than formal organisations, frameworks and norms. The proposed Protection Network is a partnership between the University of Edinburgh, Open University of Sri Lanka, Law and Society Trust, USIU-Africa, Aalborg University and the University of East Anglia and will extend out to include other researchers and practitioners interested in the complex protection needs of vulnerable populations.   Conceptualising protection from the bottom up allows us to appreciate the multiple forms that protection needs take, as they are embedded in social, economic and political contexts. Focusing on people rather than events or normative frames means we can see crisis as non-exceptional, and break with the divide between prevention and response. Doing so also helps us move beyond the silos that have shaped humanitarian interventions, to learn across distinct research and policy domains and to support new communities of practice. It allows us to understand the multiple ways in which people seek to protect themselves from violence - which may, for example, relate to livelihoods as much as legal entitlements - whilst acknowledging that these practices might themselves be contradictory, counter-productive and exclusionary. Either way, starting with on the ground protection needs and practices is essential if we are to begin to find solutions to affirming protective rights and to develop interventions that are both more responsive and more effective.  Kenya and Sri Lanka will act as central hubs for the Protection Network as they are sites of enduring crisis in their own right and because they are regional access points for South and Southeast Asia and East Africa. The two separate hubs will also create opportunities for new forms of South to South collaboration and learning. Both countries are marked by prolonged forms of state and non-state violence, natural disasters and displacement. At the same time, both countries have vibrant humanitarian and human rights communities and have been the site of diverse forms of international intervention.   The Protection Network will produce holistic and actionable knowledge that will be fed into more established forms of expertise. By establishing a research agenda that is rooted in lived realities rather than policy categories, the Network will bridge areas including human rights, humanitarianism and internatio",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.993641674518585

Il a également pour but d'accroître la résilience de l'Asie du Sud­Est face aux catastrophes naturelles, en aidant les collectivités à mieux collaborer avec les gouvernements nationaux et des organisations régionales, afin de mettre en place des plans et des politiques de réduction des risques liés aux catastrophes qui soient plus efficaces. Le projet permet aussi de renforcer la capacité de Sociétés nationales de la Croix­Rouge et d'organisations régionales de défendre et de communiquer les besoins des groupes vulnérables, lesquels sont souvent plus gravement touchés par les catastrophes. Le projet permet également aux Sociétés de la Croix­Rouge de travailler avec les gouvernements nationaux et des organisations régionales, afin que les lois et les politiques sur la réduction des risques liés aux catastrophes tiennent compte d'enjeux associés aux collectivités vulnérables, à l'égalité entre les sexes et à l'environnement. En outre, le projet favorise l'élaboration et la mise en œuvre de plans de travail sur la réduction des risques liés aux catastrophes entre les Sociétés nationales de la Croix­Rouge et des organisations régionales. Il aide également les Sociétés nationales à sensibiliser les populations et à renforcer les compétences en ce qui concerne les lois applicables aux interventions internationales en cas de catastrophes, aux niveaux régional, national et communautaire.",Disaster Risk Reduction,Yes,0.992102682590485

Hasta la fecha, la Franja de Gaza continúa en situación de crisis crónica. En las últimas semanas esta zona ha sido nuevamente objetivo de múltiples ataques militares por parte de Israel causando no solo daños materiales sino también bajas humanas,, afectado gravemente a la población civil. Según el Instituto Palestino de Estadística (PBCS), el porcentaje de población en situación de pobreza en la Franja de Gaza se sitúa por encima del 80%. El desempleo alcano el 41 % en el 2015, tras la Guerra de Gaza del 2014. En este sentido las mujeres se presentan como el grupo más vulnerable con un 60% de desempleo frente a un 28% en los hombres. Las razones de esta situación son: la caída del comercio exterior, la fuerte imposición de restricciones a las exportaciones de Gaza, el daño severo al capital y a la infraestructura por los conflictos armados y el alto nivel de crecimiento de la población en Gaza, lo que resulta en una alta tasa de crecimiento de la fuerza laboral, pero no un aumento en las oportunidades laborales. Los servicios básicos como la electricidad y el agua se encuentran prácticamente en desuso, por lo que se perciben un alto nivel de necesidad de atención a la salud de la población más vulnerable (niños/as y mujeres).Por los motivos reflejados, la intervención que se presenta se dirige a cubrir las necesidades básicas de atención y salud materno infantil integral a 90 mujeres embarazadas, sus 90 bebés neonatos, y sus 180 hijos/as menores de 5 años, teniendo en cuenta que cada mujer en Palestina cuenta con 2 hijos/as de media. En Palestina no existe un sistema público de salud comparable al modelo del Estado del Bienestar, por lo que el 45% del gasto sanitario proviene de pagos realizados por las familias, el 30,5% del gasto lo financia el gobierno, el 19% del gasto lo financian las ONG's. El PIB destinado al sector sanitario de Gaza del 10.7 %.Entre los problemas más serios que afectan a la población de mujeres embarazadas encontramos la anemia. La tasa de prevalencia de anemia entre las mujeres embarazadas es del 35,7%. Durante la gestación, el estado de salud de las madres influye en el desarrollo y crecimiento del bebe, pudiendo causar la mortalidad de los/as neonatos/as y menores de 5 años. Es más, por cada 1.000 nacidos vivos, el nivel de muertes prematuras es de 19.3 en neonatos/as recién nacidos y 31.8 en menores de 5 años. Por otro lado se señala la alta tasa de violencia basada en el género (VBG) que afecta a la población de mujeres Palestina, residentes en la Franja de Gaza.

Programa de desayunos escolares en las guarderías de las 4 dairas, de los Campamentos de Población Saharaui de Tindouf, RASD :: El proyecto pretende contribuir a la mejora de la situación de salud de la población infantil saharaui de entre 3 y 6 años, garantizando el correcto funcionamiento del Programa de Desayunos Escolares en 24 guarderías de las Wilayas de Ausserd, Aaiun, Smara y Bojador. El Ministerio de Educación comenzó en 2003 un programa para complementar la alimentación de la población infantil en las guarderías de los campamentos, Se financiaba a través de la cooperación catalana. Con la crisis se recortaron los fondos y tuvo que suspenderse. En 2013 el Gobierno de Taiwan aportó fondos para este proyecto. En el periodo 2015-2016 y 2016-2017 se estaba financiando con fondos del Gobierno Vasco. El proyecto contribuirá a mejorar la salud de la población infantil de 3 a 6 años, reduciendo los índices de malnutrición y anemia vinculados a la implementación del Programa Desayunos Escolares en 24 guarderías de los campamentos de refugiados saharauis, procurando el aumento del aporte energético y la diversidad alimentaria.

Seguridad alimentaria de la población refugiada en la  Franja de Gaza, PALESTINA :: A consecuencia de la situación de bloqueo e inestabilidad permanente en la Franja de Gaza, la inseguridad alimentaria de la población refugiada de Palestina aumenta constantemente. Gracias al reparto de ayuda alimentaria, el presente proyecto mejorará la seguridad alimentaria y las condiciones de vida de las personas más vulnerables.   El bloqueo impuesto por Israel sobre la franja de Gaza desde hace doce años ha dejado a la población en una situación de extrema vulnerabilidad, dificultando cada vez más la provisión de bienes y suministros básicos para la población y destruyendo el tejido productivo de la zona. Además, el largo bloqueo económico y militar está directamente unido a un alarmante nivel de desempleo y a un grave debilitamiento de los sectores productivos principales como la pesca y la agricultura. En este contexto, los niveles de pobreza siguen aumentando, así como la dependencia de los servicios de UNRWA.  Además, la inestabilidad política en la zona y los frecuentes episodios de violencia aumentan la vulnerabilidad de la población. En ausencia de medios de vida y perspectivas de ingresos entre la población, la asistencia internacional se encarga de mantener unas condiciones de vida dignas. En Gaza, UNRWA brinda servicios a más de un millón y medio de personas refugiadas de Palestina y mantiene un programa de emergencia para ayudar a los más vulnerables. La dependencia abrumadora de los alimentos de emergencia y la asistencia en efectivo atestigua la profundidad de la crisis de la dignidad humana.   Desde 2018, la Agencia ha tenido que hacer frente a las consecuencias del cese de la ayuda de Estados Unidos, que era el principal donante de UNRWA con una contribución de 360 millones de dólares anuales.  Este recorte obligó a la Agencia a realizar diferentes recortes y reajustes e incluso, en algunos casos, a suprimir de forma provisional algunos programas, con graves consecuencias para la población beneficiaria. Al mismo tiempo, se han priorizado aquellas intervenciones que son más importantes para dicha población beneficiaria, como es el caso de la presente intervención.  Para 2019, se previó que las necesidades en cuanto a ayuda alimentaria en Gaza sean de un total de 94.561.301 dólares para poder dar asistencia a las personas más vulnerables.  La aportación concedida por el Ayuntamiento de Bilbao se dirigirá a mantener el programa de ayuda alimentaria en Gaza, buscando reducir la inseguridad alimentaria de las personas refugiadas de Palestina que viven en situación de pobreza absoluta, a través de la distribución de cestas alimentarias. Gracias a este proyecto, 2.266 personas que viven bajo el umbral de la pobreza absoluta (1,74 USD por persona y día) y que viven en situación de especial protección verán cubiertas como mínimo el 80% de sus necesidades nutricionales y calóricas diarias durante un período de 3 meses med",Material relief assistance and services,Yes,0.991158306598663

In addition, irrigation water supplies to 11,724 hectares of arable land were disrupted. About 90 percent of the people served by the system live below the poverty line. The system was completed in 1968, and consists of a tunnel, an open canal of about 28 kilometers (km), and three inverted siphons with a total length of about 3 km that convey water through three valleys. The earthquake damaged one siphon, disrupting the water supply. The Government agencies took immediate action and within a month had laid temporary pipelines partly restoring water supply. The Project will restore water supply by installing permanent replacement works, and rehabilitate facilities that pose a threat, thus safeguarding against failure risks.

Esta dependencia se ha visto agravada desde el año 2015 con la reducción del actual nivel de financiamiento en el reparto de alimentos: en diciembre de 2015 se dio una ruptura del stock de la leche que era distribuida por el PMA en las guarderías de los campamentos, lo que supuso una merma considerable en la ingesta de nutrientes de los niños y niñas de estos centros. En octubre de 2016 el PMA se vio obligado a suspender parte de su asistencia alimentaria, debido al déficit de financiación y, de nuevo, el 15 de mayo de 2017 el PMA tuvo que detener la distribución de productos nutritivos especializados para la prevención y el tratamiento de la anemia, el retraso del crecimiento y la malnutrición entre miles de madres embarazadas, lactantes y sus hijos pequeños. El principal obstáculo para los agentes humanitarios sigue siendo la escasez de financiación, lo cual se teme se vea incrementado ante la actual pandemia de Covid, todo lo cual tiene severas consecuencias, sobre todo, en colectivos altamente vulnerables como la infancia: en 2019 el 50% de los niños/as menores de 5 años tenía anemia, 28% malnutrición crónica y un 8% padecía desnutrición aguda.

Siguiendo los criterios de selección para la población beneficiaria, a través de este proyecto se distribuirán cestas alimentarias a 2.284 personas refugiadas entre los diferentes puntos de distribución que UNRWA tiene a lo largo de la Franja. Estas personas, además de estar en situación de pobreza absoluta, son clasificadas por UNRWA como casos de especial protección, puesto que tienen vulnerabilidades añadidas, como ser mujeres supervivientes de violencia de género, personas con diversidad funcional, etc. Durante más de 50 años de ocupación, la población refugiada de Palestina ha venido demostrando una capacidad extraordinaria para enfrentarse a condiciones límite. Sin embargo, las graves consecuencias derivadas del bloqueo, como son el deterioro de las condiciones materiales de vida, el agotamiento de los recursos naturales, y la depauperación de la vida social y del desarrollo económico, no para de erosionar y desgastar la capacidad de resistencia de la población refugiada de Palestina. Esta capacidad de resistencia, o de afrontamiento de las dificultades, entendida como resiliencia, es decir, como la capacidad de las personas, los hogares, las comunidades y las instituciones para anticiparse, resistir, recuperarse y transformarse de eventos traumáticos y crisis? es y ha sido seña de identidad de la población refugiada de Palestina y, en especial en la Franja de Gaza. Esta seña de identidad se encuentra cada vez más en peligro, debido a la vergonzante falta de respuesta política de la comunidad internacional y a la impunidad de las constantes y repetidas violaciones de los Derechos Humanos que comete el estado de Israel.",Food assistance,Yes,0.989663779735565

The selected towns are prone to river flooding, river erosion, waterlogging, and flash floods. The poorer income groups, especially recently settled dwellers, are the most vulnerable to disaster. Lack of flood protection and inadequate drainage lead to waterlogging and overflowing of sewerage facilities, especially latrines, and cause widespread environmental degradation and deplorable unsanitary living conditions. The integrated approach, combining river protection works with drainage and basic sanitation services, is appropriate for the urban areas in Bangladesh, which are prone to frequent river flooding, particularly in low-lying areas with poor drainage systems. In the project design, flood protection works are fully integrated with drainage system improvement, sanitation, and solid waste management to establish better environmental conditions and morehygienic living conditions for the poor in the slums. While most of the project investments will be directed toward the construction of infrastructure facilities for urban flood protection, the participating towns will also implement the Urban Governance Improvement Action Program (UGIAP) which was originally introduced in an earlier Asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted project in six key result areas, four for enhancing awareness and participation of local stakeholders in urban planning and management, and two for improving accountability and transparency in municipal administration.

Through these dialogues, as a project team and with broader partners and advisors, we lay the foundations both for a coherent and cohesive research Network and for future collaborations.   The proposed global Network for Edu-Peace is grounded in the assumption that educators in settings affected by conflict and crisis are already, to varying extents, working towards peace.  The network aims to have a positive impact on the welfare of children and young people in settings affected by conflict and crisis through a focus on their education, and in particular through a focus on peace-building.   Central to the Network is peer-to-peer learning and collaboration with academic, government, NGO and community partners through the identification of case studies in three regions affected by conflict: South-South East Asia (Bangladesh & Myanmar), the Horn of Africa (Somaliland & South Sudan), and the Middle East (Lebanon). Building on existing research, and connections with partners in these regions we aim to: deepen understandings of key challenges in emergency contexts, identify innovative and successful education and peacebuilding practice, particularly through case-studies of non-traditional education programmes or projects, highlight and develop conflict-sensitive and gender-sensitive provision, facilitate peer-to-peer learning and knowledge exchange, generate capacity and new pathways to locally-responsive impact, generate new interdisciplinary knowledge that will advance the fields of Education, Law, Politics, Gender Studies and History.

The gradual implementation of the long-term cooperation takes the massive challenges that South Sudan faces after independence into account, where the country's own capacity is severely limited, and long term aid needs to operate in parallel with other instruments (political, humanitarian, peace/stability, military) The Program Support Part ll continues the previous focus on the connection between development and security/peace- and state build-up in accordance with South Sudan's own development plan and the principles in New Deal, where South Sudan is a pilot country.The goal is a peaceful and stable South Sudan capable of upholding the respect for Human Rights, Good Governance and access to social services. Part ll consolidates and enhances the two present components, Governance and Human Security, which are highly prioritized from political side in South Sudan. The support is directed through multilateral channels and is adjusted to national systems. In the area of governance the central and decentralised capacity of authorities will be strengthened with focus on accountability and transparency and service delivery to rights holders, meaningful participation in decision-making processes and access to social services at local level. In the area of security focus is on conflict prevention in marginalized local communities as well as the government's capability to take responsibility for the population's right to a life in security and anti-discrimination.

Whilst climate change has generated a crisis of livelihoods, food insecurity, and internal and cross-border migration in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Jordan, the issue has garnered relatively little international attention. What is more, whilst the focus of education provision and capacity building among dispersed and vulnerable populations has been the development of mobile technology and the top-down dissemination of targeted content, fewer initiatives have focussed on the use of participatory arts and humanities based methodologies, which not only facilitate a deeper engagement with local cultural and socio-political contexts, but also enable more collaborative and innovative bottom-up approaches to knowledge co-production and exchange.   The research network connects researchers, academic institutions, arts practitioners, and small-scale arts and culture NGOs in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jordan, and the UK, with each other, and with socio-economically vulnerable urban youth in Cuba, rural youth in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and and young refugees in informal settlements in Jordan. Network participants will co-facilitate and take part in participatory photography and storytelling workshops, local and international exhibitions of the work they produced, and local and international learning labs designed to promote evidence-based reflection on the practical potential of participatory photography and storytelling to for developing local and international educational models and materials for education on climate change. Based on the experiences, work and research produced as part of the participatory photography and storytelling workshops and learning labs, network participants will also co-produce locally-relevant materials on climate change induced food and livelihood insecurities and local solutions that can be developed to address them, and an open-access online module on climate change induced challenges in Cuba, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Jordan.",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.988736927509308

To achieve these objectives, the project provides food insecure households with predictable food or cash transfers.

The rationale behind this choice of countries is clear. These countries are affected by protracted and aggravated conflict associated with Islamic extremism (Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province). The Lake Chad Crisis is a complex and multidimensional conflict, which our research seeks to address. The focus of this observatory are not these four affected countries as a whole, but the regions within these ODA-listed countries most affected by extremist violence-- all currently classed Red Zones. These regions are Diffa in Niger, Borno in Nigeria, Region du Lac in Chad, and the so-called Extreme North region of Cameroon. This award will enhance existing capability for action research in and across these remote regions, laying foundations for a four-year programme that will address an urgent need for multi-regional and multinational peace cooperation. 'Staging Peace' can pave the way for sustainable and inclusive peace-building, as prompted by this GCRF call, through the creation of an observatory that will evaluate and monitor reintegration programmes across the four affected regions. In the present context, reintegration is understood within the UN framework of de-radicalisation, demobilisation, and reintegration (DDR). This award will also facilitate partner equitability, South-South knowledge sharing, and trust-building among the academic and non-academic stakeholders involved, in order to set in motion a trajectory of research that will better understand, and in a more nuanced way, how reintegration works in practice for the benefit of local communities. Evaluation of good practice will enable us to inform decision-makers and policy stakeholders, including multinational and national armies, DDR programmes set up by national and local governments, and humanitarian actors. The importance of media arts as chosen tool for reintegration is justified given the central role played by media technology in Boko Haram's radicalisation agenda and propaganda apparatus. This award will enable us to continue building network relations with key media and arts groups involved in the reintegration agenda, particularly radio and television stations, theatre groups, and local community groups (i.e. religious or traditional leaders and opinion makers). Support from AHRC-GCRF will likewise enable the 'Staging Peace' team to strengthen the administrative and management capabilities needed for the realisation of a Network Plus programme, not least at the level of post-award capability within the University of Leeds. A number of Network Plus specifics will be addressed throughout this 12-month award, including the shaping of a commissioning strand and devolved budgets, the planning for synthesis of",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.988416731357574

Atención médica y suministro de medicinas para población refugiada congoleña en el Campo de Refugiados de Lovua, Lunda Norte, ANGOLA :: El brote de violencia en la región de Kasai de la Rep.Dem.Congo (RDC) en marzo de 2017 provocó el desplazamiento interno de aproximadamente 1,4 millones de personas y más de 35.000 refugiados en la provincia de Lunda Norte en Angola. El flujo de llegadas disminuyó en julio de 2017 y el gobierno angoleño no aceptó más llegadas de personas refugiadas. La rebelión de Kamwina Nsapu, también conocida como la rebelión de Kamuina Nsapu, es una rebelión continua instigada por la milicia Kamwina Nsapu contra las fuerzas de seguridad del estado  en la República Democrática del Congo (RDC), en las provincias de Kasaï-Central, Kasaï, Kasai-Oriental, Lomami y Sankuru. Los combates comenzaron después de que la milicia liderada por Kamwina Nsapu atacara a las fuerzas de seguridad en agosto de 2016. Hay una naturaleza étnica en el conflicto con la milicia formada principalmente por lubos que han matado selectivamente a personas no lubas. El conflicto ha evolucionado a partir de una rebelión contra el estado para involucrar a la violencia étnica. A pesar del proceso de repatriación organizada voluntaria que se inició en octubre de 2019 en el campo de refugiados, las necesidades médicas en la zona siguen siendo altas. Se necesita contar con los medicamentos esenciales y materiales para ofrecer servicios de atención primaria de salud y salud mental  gratuitos y de calidad. Entre los medicamentos básicos indispensables están los antibióticos, antipiréticos, analgésico y antipalúdicos. La malaria, las infecciones respiratorias, diarreas y dolores musculoesqueléticos suponen un gran porcentaje de las consultas que se realizan en las clínicas, siendo el motivo de más de setecientas consultas de media semana. Otros medicamentos como antihipertensivos y antidiabéticos permiten el tratamiento de las patologías crónicas más frecuentes. Como consecuencia de las condiciones de vida, las cifras relativas a patologías como parasitosis o malnutrición se han ido incrementando. Con este incremento se hace indispensable el aumento de medicamentos, suplementos nutricionales y material dirigido, no sólo al tratamiento, sino también a la prevención. Es, por tanto, necesario la compra de medicamentos y del transporte de los mismos. A mitad de 2019 más de 20.000 personas provenientes de la RDC residen en el asentamiento de Lóvua.

Despite of the many refugee-hosting countries (RHC) being low and middle-income countries ( LMICs), often with inadequate resources to meet the demands of this refugee influx. It has been recognised that cultural and creative industries (CCIs) have positively contributed towards fostering intercultural dialogue between host communities and refugees in RHCs (UNESCO, 2018). However, could technologies scale up such creativity to act as an 'enabler' for RY integration or access to vocational education and training (VET) the RHCs? Given the insufficient resources and lack of necessary infrastructure to facilitate much needed inclusive refugee integration systems, and the focus being put on primary and secondary school enrolment as well as humanitarian interventions, there is only weak research evidence from RHCs' perspective.  Developed as a part of the GCRF Education in Conflict and Crisis Research portfolio, this project is aimed at providing baseline research for an interdisciplinary arts and social science network plus- (Creative Network) which aims to investigate how innovations in technologies (mobile and digital) can support CCIs for Refugee Youth (RY) (young people aged 16-32 years) that will enable better integration and access to VET in the Network-hosting communities of 6 of the world's top 10 RHCs - Turkey, Uganda, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Lebanon and Ethiopia. This project will advance our theoretical understanding, build strong, equitable and sustainable partnerships, and support the engagement of the Creative Network's stakeholders.   Building on knowledge gained through the experiences of previously funded GCRF projects such as the 'Building futures' and RELIEF projects, this project aims to identify, increase and promote equitable and sustainable opportunities for our Creative Network's collaborators and partners, local communities and wider stakeholders to co-design ideas to support the full Network plus proposal. Adopting qualitative, co-production and action-research methodologies, we will work in partnership with researchers at HEIs and IROs across the case RHCs, and collaborating partners such as UNHCR, UNESCO, UNICEF, Action on Armed Violence, Finn Church Aid, Habitat, Multeciler etc'.   We will begin the project by undertaking stakeholder mapping activities that includes identifying and negotiating access to different refugee youth and groups, and other stakeholders (e.g. community leaders, Government representative, project partners, VET representatives, academics including ECRs etc.), carrying out a critical review of local and international policies and programmes of RY integration and VET in each RHC, in order to highlight innovative practice, as well as areas that require further investigation. we w",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.987995207309723

Achieving inclusive growth involves looking beyond monetary indicators and GDP, and towards multidimensional notions of prosperity that reflect people's quality of life and well-being. There is growing evidence that inequality is harmful to individuals and societies, and that both social and economic inclusion contribute to sustainable gains in prosperity. Prosperity is consistently eroded by poor educational opportunities, poor health, poor social cohesion, and poor employment prospects. But what does it take to achieve inclusive growth of prosperity in today's world, where 63.5 million people are forcibly displaced according to the UNHCR? Given the magnitude of displacement across the globe, it is no longer enough to see movement as an anomaly. The geopolitics of war, climate change and social inequality mean that this is now the 'new normal' for people, whether they are 'hosts' or 'movers'. In response to this, the RELIEF Centre will mount an interdisciplinary social science project that will speed up the globally critical sustainability transitions required to improve the quality of people's lives. The core will be a programme of research, education and civic engagement that develops a vision of future prosperity for Lebanon - the country with the largest number of refugees per capita in the world today - but with findings and outputs that will be applicable to other countries throughout the world. The Centre's research programme comprises the following four research themes (R1 to R4), addressing key aspects of inclusive growth for prosperity and social cohesion:   R1 Post Conflict Cities will examine how Syrian refugees and their host Lebanese communities that can collectively participate in the design of more resilient and better quality living environments in contexts of resource constraint in Lebanon. This theme will also explore mechanisms for public engagement in the reconstruction of cities in Syria if/when Syrian refugees decide to return.   R2 Creating Value will identify existing collective goods for communities (of both hosts and refugees) in Lebanon, as well as the most efficacious forms of investment in communities to address their needs. This strand will consequently develop a model to assess the value of successful community-driven projects for enhancing and delivering collective goods in terms of both job creation and well-being.   R3 Future Education will mobilise new technologies to deliver affordable education to refugees and hosts in Lebanon, as well as generate data for the three other research themes.

Description: As a one-time only grant for research and policy development on international law and conflict in the Arab region. The intensification of the Syrian crisis over the past nine years has had devastating consequences for the Arab region. As Syria became a focal point for competing geopolitical interests, parties to the conflict continue to commit human rights abuses and violations of international law. The Institute for the Study of Human Rights (ISHR) at Columbia University is an academic center committed to to the study of human rights and the promotion of dialogue between scholars and practitioners through lectures, conferences, and capacity building activities. This project will monitor conditions, raise awareness about human rights abuses, and recommend policy solutions to policy-makers in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere to enhance peace prospects in Syria through better informed and more effective mediation. Corporation support will contribute to conferences, policy briefings, staff costs, and travel.",Human rights,Yes,0.987671375274658

This project aims to pivot programming activities during school closures to minimize the impact of health and economic-related shocks resulting from limited mobility and loss of income felt by students and their families. This project modified its modality from on-site school meals to take-home rations for students and their families, preserving nutritional status and educational outcomes. Food baskets continue to support 41,000 children initially targeted by the project to maintain distance-learning and help create favourable conditions for their return once schools reopen. The proposed approach supports 28,700 households over three months with a minimum nutritional and caloric intake. Food baskets are used as a platform to increase communication around COVID-19 prevention measures, such as hygiene and social distancing. The project also reached the Cabo Delgado province, currently experiencing a humanitarian crisis resulting from an increasing number of internally displaced persons and rising COVID-19 rates. / Ce projet appuie des activités qui répondent à la pandémie de COVID-19 au Mozambique. Ce projet vise à orienter les activités de programmation pendant la fermeture des écoles afin de minimiser l'impact des chocs liés à la santé et à l'économie résultant d'une mobilité limitée et de la perte de revenu ressentie par les élèves et leurs familles. Ce projet a modifié sa modalité de repas scolaires sur place pour offrir des rations à emporter pour les élèves et leurs familles, en préservant l'état nutritionnel et les résultats scolaires. Les paniers alimentaires continuent d'aider les 41 000 enfants initialement visés par le projet pour maintenir l'engagement d'enseignement à distance et à créer des conditions favorables à leur retour une fois les écoles sont rouvertes. L'approche proposée soutient 28 700 ménages sur une période de trois mois avec un apport nutritionnel et calorique minimal. Les paniers alimentaires sont utilisés comme plate-forme pour accroître la communication autour des mesures de prévention de la COVID-19, comme l'hygiène et l'éloignement social.

The overall objective of the programme is to contribute to the stability and resilience of 93 communities in the five states South Kordofan, Blue Nile, West Kordofan, White Nile and North Kordofan. The targeted communities were selected on the basis of a multidimensional poverty and conflict exposure analysis conducted by UNDP and are characterized by being on the verge of conflict, suffering from high unemployment rates (particularly among women and youths) and/or hosting large groups of IDPs/refugees/migrants. Limited economic opportunities and resource scarcity has further exacerbated development challenges in many of these communities and are likely to contribute to distress and conflicts in the near future if left unaddressed. The programme aims at building inclusive livelihoods and strengthen socio-economic resilience of the targeted communities by addressing the specific needs of e.g. unemployed youth, displaced population and women at risk.The programme budget is US$ 17,066,000.  Other donors include Japan, Italy, UK and Spain. The programme has recently (January 2018) entered into its second phase during which it is planning to reach a minimum of 9,300 direct and 279,000 indirect beneficiaries in the prioritized communities. Sida is considering a support of approx. 45 000 000 SEK during 2018-2020.The specific objectives of the programme are:1) To strengthen the resilience of unemployed youth who have the potential to be radicalized and mobilized to join conflicts by the provision of livelihood support and generation of the rural economy in the southern States bordering South Sudan2) To promote stability and peace-building by strengthening the resilience of communities hosting refugees and migrants from South Sudan and IDPs resulting from internal conflict by providing socio-economic infrastructure and assets to benefit all.3) To enhance the capacity of peacebuilding structures at the community, state, and national levels to continue promoting and engaging in peace initiatives, positive transformation of youth, networking and provide space for dialogue and learning.Programme activities focus on 1) providing alternative livelihoods for unemployed youth through, e.g., farming activities, vocational skills training, workshops and awareness raising, 2) replacement of basic infrastructure (e.g. water pumps) in conflict-ridden communities, 3) strengthening of community resilience and social cohesion, 4) capacity development of Community Management Committees (CMCs) and local government entities. Start-up support for local businesses, facilitation of linkages with the private sector and financial institutions, creation of short-term jobs and support to community-based initiatives will also form part of the comprehensive programme.","Civilian peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution",Yes,0.985374212265015

Ha habido un aumento de la población del 41% respecto de la cifra arrojada durante el Censo del año 2001.La zona donde se ubica el proyecto ha sido muy vulnerable y por ello desde 2002 los Hermanos de La Salle iniciaron su trabajo. En ese momento, post crisis 2001, lo más urgente era facilitar el acceso de sectores vulnerables a una propuesta educativa de calidad.

Con este nuevo proyecto se pretende aportar a la construcción de 2 talleres ya que el edificio se construye por etapas para dar respuesta a las necesidades de los estudiantes y los recursos que se van generando.   Con esta propuesta educativa, que año a año se consolida, se pretende dar herramientas a quienes concurren para que puedan trazar trayectorias vitales que los alejen de las opciones que la pobreza les ofrece más relacionadas con el consumo problemático de sustancias y actividades ilegales.

El 3%son niños de diversos orígenes y con necesidades específicas, junto con 28.800 refugiados palestinos que en añosanteriores se refugiaban en Siria y una población preexistente de unos 180.000 refugiados palestinos del Líbanoque viven en 12 campamentos y 156 pequeños asentamientos.La presión en las comunidades de acogida es tan grande que está afectando a la estabilidad de muchosmunicipios y como consecuencia las personas refugiadas sufren cada vez más presiones para retornar,ocasionándose tensiones sociales. Ante esta situación ACNUR, en ejercicio de su mandato internacional, se encargade preservar el espacio de asilo y velar por la protección internacional de estas personas, así como de contribuir asu bienestar básico.El nivel de pobreza de esta población es del 68 por ciento, encontrándose en situación de alta vulnerabilidad acausa de factores tales como el nivel de deuda de las familias o la precariedad de las viviendas que continúanaumentando, al igual que, entre otras muchas carencias, permanecen o aumentan los riesgos de explotación yotros relacionados con la protección como el trabajo infantil (el 5% de menores entre 5-17 años trabaja aumentandoeste porcentaje a cerca del 15% en la franja de edad entre 13-15 años siendo el 3.2% niñas) o los matrimoniostempranos (el 29% de las niñas de entre 15 a 19 años estaban casadas en el momento de realizar un estudio en2018, un incremento medio del 7% respecto del año anterior). El alto nivel de pobreza de las familias sirias suponeque éstas no pueden afrontar las necesidades más básicas, tales como la vivienda, la alimentación, la salud o laescolarización de los menores.. Dadas las limitadas posibilidades de obtener medios de vida, los/as refugiados/asmás vulnerables continúan dependiendo de la asistencia humanitaria.Las familias encabezadas por mujeres representan el 15% de la población y reportan las peores condiciones ymayor vulnerabilidad. Estas sufren de mayor inseguridad alimentaria que las encabezadas por hombres (95% vs292%), se ven obligadas a adoptar estrategias negativas de afrontamiento con mayor frecuencia (74%) y destinan unmayor porcentaje de su gasto a adquirir alimentos (24%).

Sites of heritage enrol people into particular practices, engagements with and negotiations of the past, and they are important spaces of informal learning about peace and reconciliation as a result. There is growing expectation that international, national and local heritage agencies and actors have a positive role to play in the prevention of conflict and post-conflict development yet these spaces are often neglected in considerations of education, as they are informal sites where memory work is undertaken but neglected in formal curriculum. This means that there is currently little understanding of the impact of informal heritage learning for sustained peace.  The network will produce interdisciplinary knowledge, build local research capacity within heritage organisations and strengthen an international collaboration for developing future research projects. Through this, it will directly contribute to the Ugandan Peace, Recovery and Development Plan and Refugee and the Host Population Empowerment Strategy. It will also address the global challenges and sustainable development goals of (1) enabling inclusive and equitable quality education and (2) reducing conflict and promoting peace, justice and humanitarian action.  The network focuses on recent and ongoing innovative heritage work by Nelson Abiti (the Ugandan Co-investigator of Uganda Museum) and associated cultural organisations. These mobile exhibitions seek to bring about informal learning about peace and reconciliation and achieve community cohesion amongst a variety of participant groups but tthe impact of which have not been tested. The network activities provide space for academics from the humanities and social sciences, heritage practitioners, government officials and participant groups to (1) reflect on the types of learning that are happening in these informal heritage sites and (2) co-construct meaningful and contextually-appropriate ways to assess this learning. The participant groups will include ex-combatants, refugees, community leaders, women peace club members, abductees and survivors.  Research capacity will be developed among Ugandan cultural organisations to understand and assess learning. We will co-develop informal learning indicators based on participants' reflections on their engagement with informal heritage learning. These will be of significant interest to a range of stakeholders concerned with the role of heritage sites in contributing to peaceful sustainable development in Uganda and across East Africa. The network will develop sustained international relationships that have the potential for longer-term research collaboration leading to significant impact.

The project focuses on improving the livelihoods of IDPs and the host communities they live in inside Syria. By offering a variety of measures such as short-time working capacity building, reconstruction of enterprises, entrepreneurship, local micro-credit, etc. insert may contribute to the gradual building of resilience in particularly affected groups (individuals, families, local communities).The operations will be conducted in both regime- and opposition controlled areas. Since there is a great lack of statistics and analysis, the project will also include a component for knowledge building, methodology development, and the like. A significant portion of households in Syria are headed by women and the proportion of people with disabilities is very high (both physical disability and psychosocial). These categories are clearly a priority in the proposal.The consortium's initiative is the first of its kind with this reach, both geographically and thematically. It is still in in a relatively early stage of formation and a number of important questions/instruments need clarification and to be developed during the first project period. It is managed by CARE and will have its head office with a secretariat / Project Management Unit in Amman. Representatives of the six members constitute the Board (the Steering Committee). Geographical coordination and management will take place from 4 sites in the region (hubs), which are already functional but is being expanded to strengthen the capacity and these are responsibilities/functions between consortium members.After three years of successful implementation a request for additional support for one year (2020) has beeen received and a decision has been made to fund this support.",Employment creation,Yes,0.981900870800018

The assessment results revealed significant negative impact from chronic water shortage and drought, therefore the project aims to enhance disaster resilience on droughts through improving access to water and agricultural practice that is more drought resilient.  Specifically, the project will provide water related information to the community for improving awareness on DRR in the area, improve access to drinking water, and improve access to agricultural water source and technology which can reduce vulnerability of the drought affected community.  In order to ensure sustainability, the project aims to build a mechanism in which community takes the ownership for maintaining and managing the activities and the assets of the project upon completion.  And the project will carry out information dissemination on technicality of the model used in the project so that it will be considered as a model process for other drought affected areas in Pakistan. Specifically speaking, initial LandSat image analysis will allow narrowing down the potential area for aquafer, which will enable the team to focus on areas to conduct ERS, which will increase probability of getting to good water source through construction of wells.

The aim of the campaign was to inform target communities about covid-19, its sympthoms, how to prevent infections and measures to be taken when infected. The project will target 144 rural communities in four counties, namely : Bong, Margibi, Bomi, Grand Cape Mount and Nimba (including Bahn refugee camp). Implementing organisation National Adult Education Association in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia will develop a simple reader friendly facilitator training manual to be used to guide the community level facilitators. After training of 48 trainers they will mobilise and train 288 community level trainers to conduct the awareness sessions in their communities. It is estimated that about 11000 (half of them women) people will participate these awareness creation sessions. As a result the rural communities have knowledge on how to prevent the spread of the virus and health sector in the areas has capacity to handle the pandemia.

2019004757-1,AFECTADA POR EL CONFLICTO,AFECTADA POR EL CONFLICTO,"Siria se encuentra inmersa en un conflicto armado desde hace ocho años que ha dejado a la población en una situación de extrema vulnerabilidad. La incapacidad de la población para proveerse de bienes y suministros básicos debido al altísimo nivel de destrucción ocasionado por la guerra, ha generado una gran dependencia de los servicios de UNRWA para cubrir las necesidades más inmediatas de las personas refugiadas de Palestina en el país. El conflicto en Siria se originó en marzo de 2011 cuando el ejército sirio reprimió las manifestaciones que se estaban desarrollando en Dar'a por el encarcelamiento de unos jóvenes acusados de realizar grafitis antigubernamentales. Se convocaron nuevas manifestaciones que también fueron reprimidas por las fuerzas de seguridad del Estado provocando un círculo de violencia que fue aumentando hasta declararse una Guerra Civil, tal y como determinó el CICR el 14 de julio de 2012. En el año 2013, tras la ruptura de su alianza con el Frente Al-Nusra (FAN), el Estado Islámico (ISIS-DAESH) se convierte en una fuerza armada dominante, bien organizada, que controla una parte importante del territorio de la República Árabe Siria y de Irak, planteando una grave amenaza para la paz y la estabilidad. En 2014 el conflicto está marcado por el gran auge y la expansión del DAESH o ISIS, que se ha apoderado de buena parte del territorio nororiental de la República Árabe Siria. En junio de 2014 el Estado Islámico se proclamó califato. Aunque se sigue considerando una guerra civil oficialmente, la incorporación de una importante variedad de facciones y grupos armados, algunos como el DAESH procedentes de otros países, así como la participación de países aliados al gobierno y de otros países apoyando a las fuerzas opositoras, dan a esta guerra civil un importante carácter transfronterizo. El Consejo de Seguridad de Naciones Unidas expresó en una resolución del 12 de febrero de 2015 su especial preocupación por las constantes y permanentes violaciones de derechos humanos perpetradas en Siria, como detenciones arbitrarias, desapariciones forzosas, tortura, desplazamiento y restricción al movimiento, asesinatos masivos, bombardeos y ataques indiscriminados contra la población civil y crímenes contra la humanidad, entre otros, así como su preocupación por el avance de ISIS y FAN. En un nuevo informe de julio de ese mismo año, se hacía eco de la difícil situación de las personas refugiadas, que vivían bajo pésimas condiciones de higiene y salubridad mientras intentaban sobrevivir a la situación de extrema violencia que se repetía constantemente. En septiembre de 2015, Rusia se unió a la lucha del Gobierno sirio frente a los rebeldes. En el año 2016, Estados Unidos y Rusia (quienes habían venido participando mediante el suministro de armas o directamente mediante ataques aéreos) deciden fomentar un alto el fuego en Siria para llevar a cabo negociaciones de paz y asistir a la población siria que se encuentra atrapada en el país sin acceso a",Material relief assistance and services,Yes,0.980189204216003

A diferencia de Cisjordania, la ocupación israelí de Gaza finalizó en 2005, cuando se desmantelaron los asentamientos israelíes dentro de la Franja. A pesar de que este desmantelamiento supuso la retirada del ejército israelí del territorio gazatí, Israel ha mantenido el control efectivo del territorio a través de la intervención del espacio aéreo, marítimo y terrestre, al cual se suman diferentes ofensivas militares que han contribuido al deterioro de la situación de la Franja de Gaza hasta el presente. El bloqueo implica restricciones al movimiento de personas y mercancías de Gaza con otras zonas geográficas, lo que limita el bienestar y desarrollo de sus habitantes. Debido a esta situación de bloqueo y a los enfrentamientos, la situación socioeconómica de la población  es de extremada fragilidad, con altos niveles de pobreza e inseguridad alimentaria. La inseguridad alimentaria en Gaza es muy alta, con casi un millón de personas dependiendo de la ayuda alimentaria proporcionada por UNRWA para hacer frente a sus necesidades alimentarias básicas. La última gran amenaza a la maltrecha economía gazatí viene derivada de la pandemia global del COVID19 que puede tener consecuencias demoledoras. En este contexto, la situación de las mujeres en la franja de Gaza es de una mayor vulnerabilidad con respecto al resto de la población, puesto que la sociedad patriarcal ahonda en las dificultades y discriminación que ya de por sí sufren, siendo la violencia de género uno de los principales problemas. Este proyecto beneficiará a 1.961 personas refugiadas de Gaza (686 mujeres y 628 menores de 18 años) con el objetivo de ?reducir la inseguridad alimentaria de las personas refugiadas de Palestina en la Franja de Gaza a través de la distribución de cestas de alimentos?.",Human rights,Yes,0.980008959770203

Although mass-starvation has killed staggering numbers of people, it is usually not conceptualized as mass-violence. Victims are rarely commemorated and actors responsible are not held accountable – despite the fact that famines are largely man-made. The proposed project aims to analyze the attempts and possibilities to pursue remembrance and justice after famines. It studies (1) under what conditions, how and by whom famines are understood, remembered and dealt with as mass-atrocities. This is done through a historical study of six famines in Africa, Asia and Europe. The project also analyzes (2) contemporary initiatives to push for remembrance and justice for hunger deaths, for instance by intergovernmental organizations, civil society groups, legal professionals, victim groups and states. Theoretically, the project understands conceptualizations of violence, memorialization and pursuit of justice as interconnected. Methodologically, the project will draw on earlier literature, archival research and media sources, and also carry out interviews with experts and key actors involved in projects of commemoration and justice. Bringing attention to the structural violence of famines, and gaining a systematic understanding of the opportunities and obstacles to bring those responsible to justice and commemorate victims will contribute to the important endeavor of preventing famines in the future.",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.979201555252075

Subprogram 2 of the program cluster will support improved fiscal management and structural measures that will place the economy on a sustainable medium-term growth path.

This will be complemented by measures that enable targeting of services to protect the vulnerable and by engagement with key stakeholders.Subprogram 2 completes the program reform agenda under the ERSP program cluster.

Researchers from Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), Makerere University (MU) and PEDER will collaborate with local artists in Kenya, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to bring together displaced populations of young people with teachers, social workers and the local education officials who make the policy and practice decisions that affect them as part of three networking meetings. The proposed network will explore the potential of different forms of artistic expression as a way of overcoming power imbalances and communication difficulties, and promoting mutual learning between stakeholders at different levels of the education system. It aims to re-think displaced young people's experience using artistic expression, supporting community artists to be co-investigators and encouraging academics to decentre their knowledge production practice to prioritise local knowledge and coproduce information using performance, poetry, oral traditions and non-linguistic forms of knowledge rather than words.  In Kenya, Dr Su Corcoran (MMU) will collaborate with Mike Wamaya, an award winning ballet teacher, to facilitate coproduction of knowledge about street-connected young people's experiences of education, through the medium of dance. The Uganda meeting, which will explore education provision for refugees, will be organised by Dr Virginie Tallio (MU) and illustrator Charity Atakunda. In DRC, Thomas D'Aquin Rubambura (PEDER) will collaborate with Faustin Muliri Miruhu, a poet and playwright, to organise a workshop with street-connected young people who have been displaced by ongoing conflict in the country. The approach of the networking meetings, of using community artists as co-investigators and artistic expression to encourage stakeholders from various levels of the education sector to co-produce knowledge, aims to enable all participants to contribute through the performance art chosen for the session. Group making activities will encourage the participants to attune, listen to and debate with each other.   In focusing on young people who are street-connected, internally displaced or refugees, the project takes an interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach - exploring intersections of experience of these populations of young people as they gain access to and transition (back) into education. Displaced populations of young people such as these, problematise the boundaries between humanitarian and international development fields of research and practice, and potentially contribute useful perspectives to research into the provision of education in emergencies and translating Sustainable Development Goal 4 into practice in protracted situations of conflict and crisis.

Para ello se trabajará fortaleciendo la sociedad civil y los procesos de construcción de paz que son imprescindibles en la región de Mindanao. Trabajamos en 3 provincias (Agusan del Sur, Bukidnon y North Cotabato) y 6 barangays, atendiendo una población total de 4.193 hogares (20.299 personas). La estrategia por tanto se establece en 4 ejes:  1. FORTALECIMIENTO DE LA SOCIEDAD CIVIL Y EMPODERAMIENTO DE LAS MUJERES: Se trabajará con 32 organizaciones de distintos sectores para fortalecerlas y mejorar su participación en la gobernanza local. Se prestará especial atención a grupos de mujeres, colectivos vulnerables e indígenas. Se espera que la sociedad civil contribuya a la mejora de la gobernanza, la gestión de la vulnerabilidad a desastres, la gestión de recursos naturales, y la resolución de conflictos. Se implicará a las estructuras de gobierno locales para ejercicios de planificación conjunta con las CSOs, gobernanza participativa, derechos humanos, y enfoque de género.  2.

El proyecto reforzará estas estructuras, aportando formación paralegal y enfoques tradicionales, y hará un mapeo de conflictos, un dialogo entre el gobierno local y la sociedad civil, mesas de paz y una campaña sobre el diálogo y la cultura de la paz.  3.

Se trabajará con la COVID Task Force, DRRM Council, Equipos de Emergencia y gobiernos tanto locales como provinciales. Se harán mapeos de riesgo y un plan de respuesta para minimizar y mejorar la preparación, reduciendo el riesgo de al menos 600 viviendas. Se trabajará con las autoridades sanitarias y se hará una campaña de prevención COVID, reforzando el sistema sanitario en la preparación y respuesta ante el COVID.  4.

El proyecto reforzará estas estructuras, aportando formación paralegal y enfoques tradicionales, y hará un mapeo de conflictos, un dialogo entre el gobierno local y la sociedad civil, mesas de paz y una campaña sobre el diálogo y la cultura de la paz.  3. COVID Y REDUCCIÓN DE RIESGO: El proyecto estudia y refuerza tanto los protocolos de respuesta al COVID y a desastres naturales como las estructuras de referencia para los mismos. Se trabajará con la COVID Task Force, DRRM Council, Equipos de Emergencia y gobiernos tanto locales como provinciales. Se harán mapeos de riesgo y un plan de respuesta para minimizar y mejorar la preparación, reduciendo el riesgo de al menos 600 viviendas. Se trabajará con las autoridades sanitarias y se hará una campaña de prevención COVID, reforzando el sistema sanitario en la preparación y respuesta ante el COVID.  4. MEDIOS DE VIDA Y AGRICULTURA: En las comunidades en las que vamos a trabajar el 96% de las familias son pobres (menos de 10.481 PHP/mes/5p) y el 88% de forma severa (menos de 7.337 PHP). Esta circunstancia afecta de forma crítica a las mujeres y grupos vulnerables. Todo esto, aportará recursos, conocimiento y oportunidades para que las personas participantes puedan mejorar sus ingresos y romper el círculo de pobreza y endeudamiento. Esperamos que al menos 540 familias en pobreza severa superen los 7.337 PHP al mes gracias al proyecto, pero las actividades de este componente se dirigen a toda la comunidad",Agricultural development,Yes,0.974209249019623

Over centuries, Wuzhou has served as a gateway city and regional transportation center to connect Guangxi with national and international markets, particularly through river transportation. In line with the Government s development program, Wuzhou will be developed into a multimode regional transportation hub through domestically funded ongoing transportation projects. However, geological and geographic conditions constrain urban development in Wuzhou. The city is in a mountainous region divided into three parts by two big rivers. Because flat urban land is lacking, the residents tended to build their houses in the marginal lands, which were gradually expanding up the mountains along slopes of major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed by loose earth, eroded granite, and clastic rocks. As such, they are vulnerable to rain-triggered geological disasters (known as geohazards) in the form of landslides, slope collapse, and mud and debris flows. Many of these valleys, though densely populated, have been classified as geohazard-prone zones.With support from the central Government, the Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) has made enormous investments to strengthen the control of geological disasters, mainly by building and rehabilitating of the slope protections and retaining walls. However, such traditional control measures have not always been economical and optimal solutions. Under severe weather conditions, these slope protections and retaining walls can be washed away together with houses and other buildings.The Guangxi Wuzhou Urban Development Project will adopt a new approach to address the geohazard concern of the city. The basic principle of this new approach to geohazard management is a shift from disaster rehabilitation to prevention. Under the Project, geological disasters are to be prevented through holistic urban planning and integrated public investment. The combination of these efforts will result in (i) carefully designed urban planning for long-term urban expansion, (ii) relocation of the people living in the geohazard-prone valley to the newly developed geohazard-free urban area, (iii) engineering measures for geohazard control to convert the evacuated geohazard-prone valley into geohazard-free land for urban redevelopment, and (iv) stronger geohazard forecasting and early warning capability to improve the effectiveness of the city s geohazard management system.The Project is aimed at promoting sustainable urban development and improving quality of life in Wuzhou.

20190090860001,Sexual and reproductive health and transactional sex in forced displacement: a comparative multi-country study,SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND TRANSACTIONAL SEX IN FORCED DISPLACEMENT: A COMPARATIVE MULTI-COUNTRY STUDY,"There is a significant gap in data concerning the patterns and drivers of transactional sex, sexual exploitation, and abuse in transactional sex and their implications on the sexual and reproductive health and rights of refugees. Though shrouded in secrecy, transactional sex is widespread among forcibly displaced populations. Women, men (heterosexual and homosexual) and transgender refugees resort to transactional sex for various reasons, including to meet their basic needs, raise sufficient money to continue their journey, or in exchange for security. In most cases, refugees who engage in transactional sex are at greater risk of physical and sexual violence, mental health problems, unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions, and HIV/sexually transmitted infections. The silence and stigma around transactional sex — especially among young women — and the poor understanding of the role of gender relations as a driver hinder access to health services and rights to health, privacy, and freedom from violence and discrimination.This comparative, multi-disciplinary, and multi-country research study will examine the gendered nature of transactional sex and the sexual and reproductive health and rights trajectories among refugee women, girls, and sexual minority persons, with the aim of developing appropriate interventions to improve policy and programmatic responses. The methodological approach will use ethnographic and qualitative methods in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey and will include preparing and piloting comparative quantitative surveys. The main analysis will describe the impact of transactional sex on sexual and reproductive health with a focus on needs and barriers to these services. This proposed research is part of a larger multi-country research program in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Sweden to examine the pattern and experiences of transactional sex and its sexual and reproductive health and rights implications across refugees' migration journeys originating in the Middle East, and in transit en route to desired safe destinations.The study will generate unique evidence to inform public health policies and interventions addressing transactional sex in refugee populations. The research will influence change by fostering a community of practice with local researchers, community members, program managers, policymakers, and other practitioners. A key outcome will be policy recommendations to address the sexual and reproductive health consequences of transactional sex among vulnerable population groups.","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.973312556743622

The silence and stigma around transactional sex — especially among young women — and the poor understanding of the role of gender relations as a driver hinder access to health services and rights to health, privacy, and freedom from violence and discrimination.This comparative, multi-disciplinary, and multi-country research study will examine the gendered nature of transactional sex and the sexual and reproductive health and rights trajectories among refugee women, girls, and sexual minority persons, with the aim of developing appropriate interventions to improve policy and programmatic responses. The methodological approach will use ethnographic and qualitative methods in Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey and will include preparing and piloting comparative quantitative surveys. The main analysis will describe the impact of transactional sex on sexual and reproductive health with a focus on needs and barriers to these services. This proposed research is part of a larger multi-country research program in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, and Sweden to examine the pattern and experiences of transactional sex and its sexual and reproductive health and rights implications across refugees' migration journeys originating in the Middle East, and in transit en route to desired safe destinations.The study will generate unique evidence to inform public health policies and interventions addressing transactional sex in refugee populations. The research will influence change by fostering a community of practice with local researchers, community members, program managers, policymakers, and other practitioners. A key outcome will be policy recommendations to address the sexual and reproductive health consequences of transactional sex among vulnerable population groups.","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.973312556743622

The floods of 1998 and 1999 were especially devastating, causing 32 deaths and agricultural and infrastructure damage estimated at $55 million. The Project aims to help Tajikistan address recurring flood risks through a holistic and coordinated approach involving both physical and non-physical measures in one of the most floodprone areas in the country - Hamadoni, Farkhor, Kulyab, and Vose districts in Khatlon province. A major part of the Project funds will be used for the physical works for the rehabilitation of 8.3 km of flood protection embankment along the Pyanj River. In addition, the project will develop and disseminate a flood risk map, strengthen flood warning systems, prepare a flood preparedness and evacuation plan, and strengthen flood forecasting capacity by rehabilitating the hydrometeorological network. Given that the Pyanj River borders Tajikistan and Afghanistan, the possible environmental impacts of the Project's physical works in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan were examined. The initial environment examination study found that there is unlikely to be significant negative environmental impact. The Project is expected to have a significant positive impact on ecological resources and socioeconomic conditions in the area. In addition, the project will help the Government define and implement the policy reforms needed to improve its flood preparedness, and to remove some of its persisting operation and maintenance (O&M) funding constraints for the flood levees and bank protection works.The Project will strengthen capacity at the Ministry of Land Reclamation and Water Resources (MLRWR) and the local government bodies to manage flood disaster risks, and to applyneed-based O&M budget planning, allocations, and monitoring for the flood protection structures.

2020006283,PhotoVoice as an educational tool for intercultural learning and peacebuilding between Forcefully Displaced Populations and Host community youth,PHOTOVOICE AS AN EDUCATIONAL TOOL FOR INTERCULTURAL LEARNING AND PEACEBUILDING BETWEEN FORCEFULLY DISPLACED POPULATIONS AND HOST COMMUNITY YOUTH,"Global numbers of Forcefully Displaced Persons (FDPs) is rising, with the majority being hosted by Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC), which can exacerbate the economic and social challenges these countries face while compounding tensions between FDPs and the host communities as they have to share scarce resources. Efforts to reduce conflict center largely on providing humanitarian aid, vocational training, and expanding the provision of welfare services, underplaying the importance of promoting peace, dialogue and intercultural learning between the groups. This network aims to address this challenge by using photography as an educational tool and photograph artefacts as a teaching and learning resource to evaluate the potential of photovoice and visual story telling as an informal learning platform for fostering peaceful relations between the communities and easing sustainable integration of FDPs. The overarching aim is to understand how visual arts and photography training can have a redistributive effect in reducing inequalities perpetuated by intersectionality of gender, ethnicity, language, sexuality, and nationality and in mitigating tensions for peace-building through comparative research in South Africa, Turkey and Uganda. These countries host millions of FDPs.  The consortium of these countries provides an enriching multi-sited context to explore the role of photography as an educational tool and the participatory methodology as an informal learning space for establishing a culture of peace, exchange of cultural knowledge, and intercultural learning.   The participatory and bottom up programs that could foster capacity building, reconciliation and societal transformation between FDPs and host communities are often ignored for the sake of economic concerns. The central aim of the network is to bring researchers, policy makers, NGOs, local actors, photographers, practitioners, FDPs and host community members to discuss photography and arts based participatory methods in providing an informal learning education opportunity for peace that could be enhanced through policy and practice. The network assembles expertise in education, photography, conflict and forced migration. The co-applicants in each country have a track record in policy-relevant research and are well networked nationally and regionally with academic, and policy actors. The network will interact through a mix of virtual and face-to-face means.   Our hypothesis is that arts training and activities conducted in an informal setting can be used for community building, and learning to live together can make important contribution to the welfare of both FDPs and host communities. To assess whether and how such benefits may be occurring and what are the best visual arts practices of adopting such a methodology, the co-applicants first have to map existing data and literature in order to gain a much clearer picture of the dynamics of FDPs and host communities and ways of improving",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.97161591053009

Las continuas restricciones a la circulación de pacientes y profesionales sanitarios y la inseguridad generalizada obstaculizan el acceso de las comunidades palestinas vulnerables a servicios básicos de salud y nutrición de calidad. Además, la oferta de servicios esenciales de salud reproductiva, atención obstétrica de emergencia y atención postoperatoria a mujeres es más escasa de la deseada, sobre todo en áreas remotas. El acceso limitado o inexistente a servicios de salud esenciales durante el embarazo genera problemas y complicaciones asociados, teniendo como consecuencia abortos, hemorragias y partos prematuros, entre otros. Este problema se agudiza aún más con la escasez de recursos humanos y materiales disponibles dentro de los hospitales, que comprometen la calidad de la atención para recién nacidos.Los recién nacidos en período neonatal (los primeros 28 días de vida) y las mujeres con embarazos de alto riesgo son particularmente vulnerables. El 45% de las muertes infantiles menores de cinco años tienen lugar durante el período neonatal y, por lo tanto, el parto seguro y la atención neonatal efectiva son esenciales para prevenir las tasas de mortalidad y morbilidad.16 En la Franja de Gaza, los servicios sanitarios del Ministerio de Salud están sobrecargadas y con pocos recursos, y el conflicto en curso ha aumentado las tasas de mortalidad materna en la región. En este escenario de escasez, los/as menores que pasan el período neonatal corren el riesgo de padecer desnutrición crónica.De cara a 2020, el Clúster de Salud y Nutrición, del que UNRWA forma parte, ha calculado que 117.600 mujeres no tendrán acceso a servicios de salud materno-infantil y nutrición adecuados en todo el territorio Palestino ocupado, de las cuales 89.984 se encuentran en la Franja.Asimismo, de cara a 2020, se han contabilizado 246.643 menores de cinco años que necesitan tener acceso a la atención sanitaria básica para asegurar su salud. 17La salud materno-infantil es uno de los pilares fundamentales de la atención primaria que desarrolla UNRWA. El objetivo general del Programa de Salud Materno-Infantil de UNRWA es reducir la mortalidad materno infantil y mejorar la atención sanitaria en los primeros años de vida. De forma específica, pretende asegurar el acceso a los servicios para identificar posibles complicaciones, prever apoyos nutricionales, medicamentos preventivos para enfermedades de transmisión madre-hijo, como el tétanos y la rubeola, inmunización de la población infantil y promoción de una maternidad sana y saludable que evite las muertes neonatales.

2020006347,Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin: interdisciplinary approaches to understanding a complex medical phenomenon,CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN: INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING A COMPLEX MEDICAL PHENOMENON,"Over the past twenty years, across Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), there has been an unexplained increase and change in the causes of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). This new type of CKD is known as Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDu), today described as a new epidemic for countries in the global south, adding substantially to the burden of CKD globally. In Mexico, the focus of this application, the problem is critical given the high prevalence of CKD and inequalities in access to appropriate healthcare. CKDu is particularly problematic because it cannot be understood in conventional causal terms, meaning it is not an outcome of diabetes or hypertension, but is, instead, linked to social, cultural and environmental concerns. CKDu predominantly affects the young, is linked to informal work (e.g. the agri-industries and mining), as well as long term environmental harm and degradation.   Despite increasing concern, it is difficult to establish the percentage of CKD deaths that can actually be classified as CKDu due to the complex conditions it emerges from. In the absence of single causes or established risk factors, explanations have been driven by community, labour and environmental activists in addition to small groups of epidemiologists, public health researchers and toxicologists engaged in exploratory research. Our partnership team has, in addition, two current independent pilot projects, conducted by University of Guadalajara (CI Lozano) and the University of Liverpool (PI Kierans). These projects are documenting a multidimensional picture of CKDu emergence, focusing on the links between the structural conditions of poverty, political economy, environment and the everyday lives of poor communities in the state of Jalisco, focusing on the community of Poncitlán on the shores of lake Chapala. Lozano is identifying the multiple risk factors and social determinants of renal damage, while Kierans takes an anthropological approach mapping the cultural production of clinical and scientific knowledge on CKDu and documenting the cultural and social practices associated with its emergence.  CKDu is, therefore, a complex problem, an outcome of geographical, geological, historical, political, economic, social and biological processes. Establishing a collaborative, genuinely interdisciplinary partnership is critical for developing ways of understanding this condition and the responses needed for those living in poor and degraded environments. Existing research largely stems from clinical and scientific perspectives and priorities. Substantive contributions from the Arts and Humanities and Social Sciences are lacking, particularly those offering historically situated and culturally contextualised insights into the changing interrelationships between poverty work, health and environment. Taking a unique interdisciplinary approach, this partnership will make valuable contributions.

2020006333,The Politics of Performance on the Urban Periphery in South India,THE POLITICS OF PERFORMANCE ON THE URBAN PERIPHERY IN SOUTH INDIA,"This network will undertake three symposia and four field trips in order to investigate the politics of performance on the peripheries of growing South Indian cities, with four festivals as case studies.We will also pilot and share the use of performance interventions towards inclusive urban planning. The growth of cities in India presents a crisis for many communities, sites and species that lie on the urban periphery and are endangered by rapid re-development and change. The performing arts are directly involved in this change. For instance, they enhance the cultural identity of the metropolis, yet may also communicate the heritage of marginalized communities and threatened sites. Traditional forms are also being developed and politicized in response to urban change, and here they share concerns with the aesthetics of contemporary performance art, which frequently engages in the politics of urban space. Animals and environmental issues are both represented and implicated in performance: for instance, the problematic care of performing elephants is exacerbated by congested urban environments, leading to growing calls for a ban. Understanding the significance of such performance is inseparable from an appreciation of the spectacle of the growing city, and the ways in which it is imagined, whether among the buyers of new property, or among those (human or non-human) who find their ways of life under threat. In order to appreciate the various ways in which performance intervenes in, comments on, and is affected by a crisis of urban expansion, it is necessary to combine expertise from a range of disciplines, particularly in relation to the cultural landscape of South India. Our network will move across humanities, social and natural sciences, including performance, archaeology, animal cognition, and urban studies. Performance studies is a growing discipline in India, but not yet well established, and the UK network participants will bring this expertise and lens to the work, while the interdisciplinary knowledge of South India will be provided by scholars, curators, artists and planning experts based in Bengaluru. The PI brings research expertise in performance, architecture and walking, recently researching Indian live art and the city. Our field trips, symposia and workshops will be held in February 2018 (Event 1), December 2018 (Event 2) and February 2019 (Event 3). The wider group will attend symposia at NIAS Bengaluru at each of the three events to discuss and share their related research alongside reports from the field trips.In February, the core group (the PI, CIs, Von Damm (MOD) and Daboo) will make field trips to observe the Urur-Olcott Kuppam Vizha, Chennai, which works with the fishing community and the Neralu (Tree) Festival, in Bengaluru.

The research is led by a consortium including experts in urban research from Africa and Asia, brought together by the Institute of Development Studies. We will focus on five cities which represent different types of urban environment: Tamale, Ghana, Mossel Bay, South Africa, Epworth, Zimbabwe, Bangalore, India and Colombo, Sri Lanka.  They were chosen because, while planning and infrastructure design and provision is improving for some parts of these cities, such provision is not expanding fast enough to keep up with urban growth and provision is not evenly distributed for all. We focus on five main types of infrastructure - water, sanitation, energy, transport and communications. In most poor neighbourhoods people meet their needs in a variety of ways - informal access to formal grids such as illegal energy hook ups, 'off-grid' forms such as latrines or bore-wells, hybrid forms such as reliance on water trucks when urban supplies run dry, or local vehicles providing 'last-mile' connections to public transport. A particular concern in these cities is whether such critical infrastructure is sufficiently robust and stable to weather the multitude of human/political and environmental shocks and stresses facing cities, ranging from droughts and floods to political and financial crises which can literally 'turn off the lights'.   In order to gain a better understanding of these systemic urban issues and how they are affecting the poorest and most marginalised, we focus our research on one key way of measuring whether basic needs are being met - whether people have stable access and availability of sufficient, diverse and nutritious diets - their 'Food and Nutrition Security'.  This provides us with a way of researching how these various infrastructures combine at multiple levels, in order to achieve a more 'systemic' understanding of infrastructure provision and the implications for people's lives. This has been little researched to date, but is critically important to understand for urban planners and infrastructure providers.  For example, water, energy and sanitation are essential for safe food preparation and disposal of human waste and also have a role to play in urban markets, alongside transport and communication. Inadequacies in access and supply can thus undermine the ability to safely cook, clean, store, supply, manufacture and grow food and add to the vulnerability of people to suffer consequences to their health, wellbeing, livelihoods and ability to care for others.   Our research starts at a city level to identify the most marginal and vulnerable settlements and how planning is envisioned in city-wide processes.  At a neighbourhood level, we will pursue statistically robust ways of capturing people's food",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.960529744625092

Over 93% of the Syrian refugee population lives in urban settlements. Though they are registered under the Temporary Protection law allowing them access to health, education, protection and livelihood services, many of them have little access to such services. The projects goal is to enhance the Syrians and host communities capacity to anticipate, manage, and recover from shocks (resilience) and improve their mutual relationship (social cohesion) through an inclusive approach in urban settings in Turkey. Beneficiaries of the project are Syrian refugees and host community members living in Krkhan, Hatay, especially vulnerable groups within the communities. Key aspect in empowering the Syrians in Hatay is Turkish language skills and access to decent jobs. The project contributes to realisation of these rights by offering training programs to improve language, technical and vocational skills, and improving employment opportunities through training programs and counselling services for Syrians and vulnerable host community members. Awareness raising activities, meetings and workshops with local authorities will be organized to ensure their involvement in future sustainability of the services. Protection services will be provided to Syrians and locals to ensure better access to the services and increase knowledge of their rights. The protection team will especially focus on SGBV and provide both referral services and awareness raising activities for affected women.

2018181657,F.a: Sustainable services for Syrian refugees,F.A: SUSTAINABLE SERVICES FOR SYRIAN REFUGEES,"Turkey hosts the largest refugee population in the world, which is around 3.9 million, among which 3.5 million are Syrians. Over 93% of the Syrian refugee population lives in urban settlements. Though they are registered under the Temporary Protection law allowing them access to health, education, protection and livelihood services, many of them have little access to such services. The projects goal is to enhance the Syrians and host communities capacity to anticipate, manage, and recover from shocks (resilience) and improve their mutual relationship (social cohesion) through an inclusive approach in urban settings in Turkey. Beneficiaries of the project are Syrian refugees and host community members living in Krkhan, Hatay, especially vulnerable groups within the communities. Key aspect in empowering the Syrians in Hatay is Turkish language skills and access to decent jobs. The project contributes to realisation of these rights by offering training programs to improve language, technical and vocational skills, and improving employment opportunities through training programs and counselling services for Syrians and vulnerable host community members. Awareness raising activities, meetings and workshops with local authorities will be organized to ensure their involvement in future sustainability of the services. Protection services will be provided to Syrians and locals to ensure better access to the services and increase knowledge of their rights. The protection team will especially focus on SGBV and provide both referral services and awareness raising activities for affected women. The education services will be extended to provide remedial support programs for children. The project will also improve the capacities of the center both in terms of staff and space to provide quality services to persons with disabilities.

Insofar and as an influential member of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Kenya also plays an important regional role in setting migration policy standards in the Horn of Africa. In most cases, displacement is protracted and refugees remain in the camps for years without freedom of movement and no opportunity to access education or employment. Despite the persistent challenges linked to Kenya's refugee response, the call for reforms of the national refugee legislation, has recently found its way into Kenyan politics, leading to an important window of opportunity. Against this background Switzerland envisages to strengthen its cooperation with the Refugee Consortium of Kenya (RCK), a national NGO advocating for the rights of refugees in Kenya.

There are more than a dozen of active volcanoes in Colombia and more than 100 overall in South America that represent significant risk to the population in nearby towns. Sudden eruptions of these volcanoes in the past caused major disasters, the latest one being the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz that melted snow and ice sending lahars into the populated area that resulted in about 20,000 casualties. Preventing volcano eruptions is impossible, but studying volcano structures and monitoring their activity may reduce the risk of disasters. Muon tomography has already been established as a tool for studying geological structures and man-made constructions, such as pyramids, volcanoes and geological repositories for CO2 storage. The potential of the technique has been recognised and sensitivity has been evaluated for some specific cases. We propose here to investigate the sensitivity of this technique to study and monitor the upper structure of volcanoes in South America to predict possible preferential pathways of debris during eventual eruptions thus reducing significantly the risk of associated disasters.",Multi-hazard response preparedness,Yes,0.953280925750732

Along with other donors, Canada's contribution offsets the additional costs of providing health services to Syrians through Jordan's public health system. Project activities include: (1) provision of primary and secondary health care services in Ministry of Health facilities and, (2) procurement of medicines, medical solutions, consumables and supplies. This multi-donor initiative is expected to benefit more than 670,000 registered Syrian refugees in Jordan. As with all pooled fund projects, Canada is working in close cooperation with other donors and the Government of Jordan to promote effective, transparent, and accountable country systems, increase donor coordination and harmonization, and strengthen mutual accountability. This kind of assistance also fosters greater policy dialogue among donors, government, and partners, which helps to strengthen efforts for effective, focussed aid, and long-term development results. This project is continuously monitored and evaluated in coordination with other donors. / Le fonds pour la santé des réfugiés en Jordanie a pour but d'appuyer le ministère de la Santé de la Jordanie afin d'améliorer la santé de centaines de milliers de réfugiés syriens en Jordanie, particulièrement les femmes et les filles. S'ajoutant aux dons d'autres pays, la contribution du Canada vise à compenser les coûts supplémentaires associés à la prestation de services de santé aux réfugiés syriens par l'intermédiaire du système de santé publique de la Jordanie. Les activités du projet comprennent : 1) l'apport de soins de santé primaires et secondaires dans les installations du ministère de la Santé, y compris des soins prénatals et postnatals et des services de planification familiale, 2) le don de médicaments, de solutions et de fournitures médicales, et 3) la prestation d'une aide technique pour renforcer la gestion, la ventilation et l'utilisation des données du système de soins de santé national en vue d'une prise de décisions fondée sur les faits.

In light of highly uncertain prospects for a prompt return to Syria in safety and dignity, the Jordan government and the international community have engaged considerable economic and political resources in order to enhance the protection and socio-economic integration of Syrian refugees. These efforts led to improved access for Syrian refugees to the Jordanian labour marked, but abuses against refugees and migrants such as exploitation, lack of safety and health equipment, poor living conditions and sexual harassment toward female workers remain widespread. In line with its Protection in the Region approach in the Middle East, Switzerland engages in a partnership with Asylum Access, a global refugee human rights organization, aiming to further protect refugees against abuses, reduce systemic barriers to refugees' safety, access to justice, self-reliance and safe and fair labor market participation. Asylum Access uses a three pillar approach, focusing on (i) capacity building for advocacy effectiveness, (ii) fostering exchange among Non Governmental Organisation working on refugee protection at the national level through the organization together with UNHCR of a global convening on legal empowerment best practices in Geneva and (iii) connecting national Non Governmental Organisation to the global dialogue on international refugee protection.","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.951072871685028

The category of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) receives a great deal of attention. However, there is limited research on how gendered violence, including violence relating to sexuality, is experienced in displacement contexts. There is also limited understanding of how gender, sexuality, and related violence affect access to healthcare, and how that can result in neglected chronic health conditions, particularly mental ill-health. Similarly, much attention is devoted to immediate healthcare needs following SGBV, but longer-term physical and mental health conditions are not adequately addressed. Displaced people face multiple barriers when seeking healthcare in protracted displacement settings, with the result that long-term health conditions are often misdiagnosed and mistreated or undiagnosed and untreated.  This project examines access to care and the responsiveness of healthcare providers for displaced Congolese and Somalis in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Somali, Kenya, and South Africa. Eastern DRC and Somalia have both experienced long-term conflict and displacement since the early 1990s, leading to large populations of Internally Displaced People (IDPs) within these countries and large refugee populations across the region. Conflict and displacement in Eastern DRC and Somalia are characterised by high rates of sexual and gender-based violence, and victims are stigmatised through prevailing gender and sexual norms. Existing health research tends to focus on the immediate aftermath of violence rather than on long-term mental and physical health conditions. The project has eight field sites in four countries. The four IDP field sites are one formal camp and one informal settlement each in Eastern DRC and Somalia, both of which have weak health systems. The four refugee field sites are Congolese and Somali settlements in Kenya and South Africa, which have different health systems and different refugee laws and policies.  The project brings together researchers and practitioners from international development, migration studies, gender studies, medical anthropology, public health and health policy, and medical sciences to undertake interdisciplinary empirical research in these protracted displacement contexts. Panzi Foundation (DRC) and War Trauma Foundation (Netherlands) will guide teams of researchers based at the University of Edinburgh (UK), the University of Kinshasa (DRC), the Somali Institute for Development and Research (Somalia), Amref International University (Kenya), and the University of Witwatersrand (South Africa). Project activities are designed to: 1) enhance the capacity of partner organisations, 2) support the inclusion of displaced people in healthcare systems, 3) foster international networks.",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.947030305862427

Somos un colectivo conformado por 14 mujeres con experiencia en educación y comunicación popular desde las mujeres.El presente proyecto se titula: ?Las norteñas empoderándonos de nuestros derechos para vivir libres de violencias?. Forma parte del Plan estratégico de Grupo Venancia 2016-2025. Se desarrolla, sobre todo, en el departamento de Matagalpa y Jinotega, con un impacto a nivel nacional.El objetivo perseguido es Contribuir al empoderamiento de mujeres adultas y jóvenes en el conocimiento y defensa de sus derechos, a vivir su sexualidad sana, libres de violencias con procesos de formación, autocuido, sensibilización y articulación con el Movimiento de Mujeres en el Norte de Nicaragua.Las actividades se desarrollarán en el norte del país, en Matagalpa y Jinotega, departamentos donde existen redes y organizaciones que son parte del Movimiento de Mujeres. Participarán mujeres jóvenes y adultas, niñas y niños, así como educadoras, madres y padres de familia, mujeres organizadas rurales y urbanas, y activistas del Movimiento de Mujeres y Movimiento social. La lógica es que son mujeres organizadas o contrapartes de grupos identificados con las redes locales de mujeres, pero también tendrán lugar como beneficiarias del proyecto personas afectadas por la crisis sociopolítica del país mediante el acompañamiento en procesos de duelo.La formación en derechos, atención a las consecuencias emocionales y sociales de la crisis sociopolítica que vivimos en dicha situación, así como el fortalecimiento de espacios donde se articulan nuestras luchas se hacen indispensables para enfrentar el contexto planteado.El proyecto desarrollará acciones de formación ? reflexión con mujeres del área rural y con estudiantes universitarios sobre el abordaje de la violencia desde el enfoque de género. Así mismo, se facilitarán espacios para la prevención del abuso sexual a la niñez con quienes mayor influencia pueden tener como son docentes, padres, madres y familiares.Se impulsará el apoyo psicosocial con sesiones terapéuticas a personas que lo necesiten de forma individual y grupal, incluidas activistas feministas que acompañan a otras personas afectadas por la violencia y la discriminación.El debate ? acción feminista, así como la coordinación de acciones con otros movimientos sociales continúa siendo una de las estrategias privilegiadas en nuestro trabajo.

Providing financing for the most urgently needed works, the loan and grant will enable the Government to redirect its own financing to housing and livelihood cash grants for the most vulnerable groups, thus restoring the economic activity essential to their survival. The project will also support ex ante disaster risk management (DRM) capacity building to mainstream resilience in development planning. Reconstruction of damaged and at-risk infrastructure in the flood-affected areas will use appropriate and cost-effective multi-hazard resistant design and construction standards to mitigate the potential impact of future disasters. The Project s design is based on the findings of the damage assessment reports prepared by the respective Punjab Planning and Development Departments (P&D) in January 2015 and facilitated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and World Bank, in close coordination with the federal government and other donors.",Disaster Risk Reduction,Yes,0.936712741851807

2020060018A,IGAD: 2020-2022 Regional Refugee Management,IGAD: 2020-2022 REGIONAL REFUGEE MANAGEMENT,"As per the data at the end of March 2019, there were almost 13 million people displaced in the  IGAD region- comprising of approximately 9.2 million IDPs and 3.7 million refugees. The main driving factors are conflicts, degradation of the environment, natural and human-made disasters, and poverty that forces people to migrate in search of economic opportunities. Accordingly, IGAD has developed a three years  project proposal that seeks to promote sound, and harmonised approach to manage refugees and asylum protection in the region and submitted to the Embassy for funding. The main rationale for the project is fact that effective protection is often beyond the reach of a single state and a successful regional framework permits responsibility for refugees protection to be distributed equitably across states, based on principles of equity, respect for sovereignty, reciprocity and solidarity.  Absence of harmonized refugees response mechanism and low implementation status of international and regionally agreed standards, conventions and treaties related to refugees are some of the challenges of the region. The main objective of the project is to promote a fair, predictable, gender-responsive and harmonized approach to refugees management and asylum protection in the IGAD region. The expected outcomes of the project are:-.  Harmonized refugee protection and managment policies, legislation and practices are improved and strengthened,.  Regional exchange and implementation of innovative and effective practices enhanced,. Technical assistance and advocacy for IGAD and its member states enhanced,The total budget planned for the intervention is 35 Million SEK for the duration of three years (2020-2022). The project will be implemented by IGAD secretariat in collaboration with UNHCR,  seven IGAD Member States and other relevant actors. The ultimate beneficiaries of the planned project are refugee and asylum seekers-women and men across the IGAD region, who owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, are outside the country of their nationality. The project also benefits national ministries in charge of refugees affair, immigration departments and foreign affair among others.","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.934149146080017

Although much has been written about informality, the area is still underdeveloped and characterised by misinterpretation, which is probably due to the complexity of the informality. Informality is an area which has had a gaind importance within and on the activities of the OECD Development Centre and where Sida assesses the Development Centre can provide important contributions to increase the understanding of the root causes of informality and policy development in the field.      Within the framework of the strategy for Sweden's global development cooperation in the sustainable environment, sustainable climate and the sea, as well as the sustainable use of natural resources in 2018 – 2022 and its goals sustainable cities and Societies, Cities Connect will focus on creating Conditions enabling secondary cities to be more efficient catalysts for sustainable urban development, poverty reduction, climate change management and resilience at local level. Their links to both major/capital cities and rural areas make secondary cities the key players in the environmental, economic and transformation process. These cities are increasingly going to play a key role in both climate adaptation and resilience-building strategies. As the population and built areas grow, energy needs will increase, while these cities are shifting to more carbon-intensive energy sources. Due to their strong links with rural areas and their dependence on primary economic activities, secondary cities will have to tackle issues such as climate-induced migration, floods, droughts, etc., as well as help capital cities mitigate environmental and socioeconomic problems. However, secondary cities face a number of binding problems that hinder their contribution to local and national development. These challenges arise from a rapid and chaotic urban expansion, which is aggravated by the lack of coordination between different levels of government, fragmented political systems and limited data and evidence for decision-making. In addition, sub-national authorities/local governmets are the first to face external negative shocks, including violent conflicts, unforeseen inflows of immigrants or refugees and more frequent natural disasters associated with climate change. Local authorities often have very limited mandates as well as poor capacities to implement policies and plans, making them heavily dependent on central government policies and financing decisions.

The phenomenon has profound negative impacts on the lives of refugees and migrants worldwide. From a Human Security perspective, developing and implementing alternatives to detention (ATD) is therefore a key area of foreign policy engagement. International Detention Coalition (IDC) is a network of more than 400 non-governmental organizations, academics and practitioners. Through its unique member-network, IDC builds on growing international commitments to ATD in order to implement reform of detention practices tailored to the national contexts in several key countries in cooperation with civil society actors. IDC acts as a catalyst and facilitator of change, bringing together key stakeholders in order to develop shared strategies.

Cox's Bazar is one of Bangladesh's poorest and most vulnerable districts, with the poverty rate well above the national average. Even before the influx, 33% of the host community population lived below the poverty line and 17% below the extreme poverty line. The arrival of the refugees has increased the supply of labour in the affected areas, driving down wages and increasing competition in the labour market, with a particular impact on the poorest host community households including those whose primary source of income is day labour. The influx has also put immense pressure on the availability and delivery of essential health services which were already scarce and overstretched. Women and girls, and women-headed households, are particularly vulnerable in this situation, including to gender-based violence which is likely to increase in times of economic stress.  The project is designed to meet the immediate needs of the affected host communities in selected sub-districts in Cox's Bazar, while building skills, resilience and awareness to facilitate their long-term well-being. With a focus on empowering and girls, the objective is to lift the most affected host communities out of poverty through a program that combines livelihoods, social safety nets, financial inclusion and social integration. Activities include: providing grants and related support to ultra-poor women for income generation activities such as home gardening and poultry-rearing, , improving household food  consumption, employment-linked apprenticeship training for out-of-school youth and adolescents (male and female), facilitating production and retailing of traditional clothing materials by women artisans, and targeted training of community health workers and midwives to help address the essential health needs of the most vulnerable host communities. The activities are expected to directly benefit over 10,000 women and young adults and reach over 200,000 members of their households. / Ce projet vise à offrir un soutien à la subsistance complet aux personnes, en particulier les femmes, les filles et les adolescents, qui vivent dans les communautés hôtes de Cox's Bazar touchées par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 Rohingyas déplacés depuis août 2017. Cox's Bazar est un des districts les plus pauvres et les plus vulnérables du Bangladesh, le taux de pauvreté y est beaucoup plus élevé que la moyenne nationale. Même avant l'afflux des Rohingyas, 33 % de la population de ces communautés vivait sous le seuil de la pauvreté, et 17 %, sous le seuil de l'extrême pauvreté.

Although much has been written about informality, the area is still underdeveloped and characterised by misinterpretation, which is probably due to the complexity of the informality. Informality is an area which has had a gaind importance within and on the activities of the OECD Development Centre and where Sida assesses the Development Centre can provide important contributions to increase the understanding of the root causes of informality and policy development in the field.      Within the framework of the strategy for Sweden's global development cooperation in the sustainable environment, sustainable climate and the sea, as well as the sustainable use of natural resources in 2018 – 2022 and its goals sustainable cities and Societies, Cities Connect will focus on creating Conditions enabling secondary cities to be more efficient catalysts for sustainable urban development, poverty reduction, climate change management and resilience at local level. Their links to both major/capital cities and rural areas make secondary cities the key players in the environmental, economic and transformation process. These cities are increasingly going to play a key role in both climate adaptation and resilience-building strategies. As the population and built areas grow, energy needs will increase, while these cities are shifting to more carbon-intensive energy sources. Due to their strong links with rural areas and their dependence on primary economic activities, secondary cities will have to tackle issues such as climate-induced migration, floods, droughts, etc., as well as help capital cities mitigate environmental and socioeconomic problems. However, secondary cities face a number of binding problems that hinder their contribution to local and national development. These challenges arise from a rapid and chaotic urban expansion, which is aggravated by the lack of coordination between different levels of government, fragmented political systems and limited data and evidence for decision-making. In addition, sub-national authorities/local governmets are the first to face external negative shocks, including violent conflicts, unforeseen inflows of immigrants or refugees and more frequent natural disasters associated with climate change. Local authorities often have very limited mandates as well as poor capacities to implement policies and plans, making them heavily dependent on central government policies and financing decisions.

The Jobs Compact arose in the follow-up to the New York Declaration on Refugees and Migrants, and its annex entitled the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF), adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in September 2016. The project builds on ongoing work to implement the CRRF and coordinate efforts to enhance refugee self-reliance in Ethiopia, which has been identified by UNHCR, in consultation with its member States, as one of the pilot countries for this exercise as part of the process in the lead-up to a Global Compact for Refugees. ILO interventions will be framed within the ILO-UNHCR Memorandum of Understanding, as revised on 2016, and the ensuing operational joint plan of action to concretize this institutional partnership.The project will focus on: (1) strengthening ILO strategic positioning in the national refugee response and leveraging new opportunities to support the implementation of the Jobs Compact and the identification of a Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, (2) enhancing the capacity of relevant government institutions and of the social partners to support the implementation of the Jobs Compact, (3) identifying the labour market demand requirements as well as potential sectors for job creation, (4) supporting a sustainable supply chain approach, and (5) conducting pilot activities.  Interventions will draw on the experience of the ILO's Syrian refugee response in Jordan and Turkey, and will offer opportunities to operationalize the ILO Guiding Principles on the access of refugees and other forcibly displaced persons to the labour market, and to apply the Employment and Decent Work for Peace and Resilience, 2017 (No. 205), in particular by supporting the active engagement of ILO tripartite constituents in the implementation of the Jobs Compact.This project contributes to the country's efforts to advance towards the achievement of SDG targets 8.8 (Protect labour rights and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers, including migrant workers, in particular women migrant, and those in precarious employment) and 10.7 (Facilitate orderly, safe and regular and responsible migration and mobility of people, including through the implementation of planned and well-managed migration policies).","Facilitation of orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration and mobili",Yes,0.893162190914154
2020006273,Pas en Avant: Community Integration through Dance-Based Pedagogy in the Lake Chad Region,PAS EN AVANT: COMMUNITY INTEGRATION THROUGH DANCE-BASED PEDAGOGY IN THE LAKE CHAD REGION,"How can teaching and learning be delivered in communities where schools have been destroyed by war? This is precisely the problem in the case of the Lake Chad conflict, affecting millions of children and women in particular, across various countries (including Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad). Not only is the degradation and regression of Lake Chad generating economic, social and political instability in and between these countries, furthermore, insecurity has been aggravated by the emergence of terrorist militancy in the region. Children in the Lake Chad region have been deprived of their right to education in order to be used as forced labour, as soldiers, or as sex slaves. It is not only formal education that will provide a solution for the local refugee population, particularly since there is no secondary school in the single UNCHR camp found in the lake region of Chad. Non-formal education can be implemented bottom-up, so that communities can enjoy their human right to social and cultural education, through autochthonous forms of knowledge production and sharing. The proposed training and evaluation to be conducted in the chosen beneficiary communities will ensure long-term continuity of NSN's work. Implementation of dance-based pedagogy in the region will greatly support community building and social stabilisation. This project will be delivered by an expert international team of social artists and community workers based in Chad, with support from network members in the UK and in neighbouring Nigeria.   Because our leading partner and friend Taigue Ahmed has family in the lake Chad, we have been granted access by the Ministry of Interior to this currently militarised zone. During meetings held in N'Djamena in May, we consulted UNCHR Chad (Nde Ndifonka) on the issue of logistics, facilitation and security. We have been assured that since the 2016 visit by the High Commissioner to Baga Sola, the UNCHR camp is completely safe for international media and researchers, and that very effective security measures will be in place for us.   In order to inform the preparation of this bid, we held a weeklong exchange with refugees from Maro and Belom camps (located in the border with the Central African Republic). This event was held as part of the previous AHRC network that feeds this proposal. This preliminary meeting has illuminated us on, and given us a sobering insight into, the extraordinary power of dance to transform lives in the region. Twenty-five refugees made an eighteen-hour bus journey in the scorching heat (up to 47 C), to be part of a weeklong series of dance workshops led by Ahmed and his team of social artists. When asked why make such extraordinary effort, the refugees replied: 'dance gives us strength and energy as a group'' 'otherwise we are alone'. One woman said that through dance, the refugee community can collectively express their message: 'There is hope for integration'. That woman, aged twenty, was attending with her four",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.892974436283112

'Precarious Publishing' focuses on a contemporary publishing phenomenon known in Latin America as editoriales cartoneras, often translated as 'cardboard publishing', because one feature that unites these 250 community organisations is the material from which they make their books: recycled cardboard. Yet the term 'cartonera' encompasses far more than the word 'cardboard'. It is also a reference to the cartonero figure - the cardboard collector or waste picker, a consequence of economic crisis, unemployment and poverty - that was so central in the formation of the first cartonera publisher Eloisa Cartonera in Buenos Aires (2003). Fifteen years on, some of these publishers, like Eloisa and Dulcineia (São Paulo), continue to work with waste-pickers. Many others have recycled the model of promoting change through community workshops, adapting it to address specific social and economic challenges: some work with groups of school children from marginalized rural areas, others with human rights in conflict zones, and others still, promoting sustainable production and consumption of materials and other resources.   The 'Precarious Publishing' research team has developed an innovative and interdisciplinary methodological framework to research on - and contribute to - cartonera practices in Mexico and Brazil. This framework is composed of a constellation of collaborative methods, including encuentros cartoneros (round-table debates and open forum discussions), co-publications, exhibitions, and workshops. The 'Activating the Arts' Follow-on-Funding develops the potential for impact arising from this process, by creating unforeseen pathways arising from ongoing engagement with our cartonera collaborators. Together, we have identified the cartonera workshop as the most robust and portable model of community outreach activity, able as it is to respond and adapt to different short and long-term development challenges. Our Follow on Funding brings together academics from Durham University and the University of Surrey, four cartonera publishers (two in Mexico, two in Brazil) - project collaborators with whom the research team have strong existing working relations - and other public stakeholders from the Ministry of Education in Mexico to the Director of the Mário de Andrade Library in São Paulo. Together, we will build, test, share and track an innovative programme of collaborative, creative workshops focused on education for sustainable development (ESD). The four cartonera publishers have been chosen because of their existing engagement with different global challenges, most particularly their work relating to inclusive and quality education, sustainable cities and communities, tackling stigma and inequality, and the promotion of peace and justice.",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.885638236999512

Access to the arts was denied to the majority of South Africans prior to 1994 and stark imbalances still remain. In Mauritius the legacy of slavery and indentured servitude are still found at the root cause of societal divisions. This history is described in the Mauritian Truth and Justice Commission Report published in 2011 as 'still open wounds that may fester if deliberate measures are not taken for national reconciliation'(31). In line with arts and culture policy in both countries there is an emphasis placed on the promotion of the arts and culture to address social injustice. Notably after years of neglect within mainstream trade and industry policy the creative industries are also now being recognised as an important growth area for the economies of Low and Middle income countries, including South Africa and Mauritius. It is within this context and in line with arts and culture policy in both countries this project focuses on art practice in sustainable development: encouraging creative excellence, empowering creative individuals and promoting and developing international networks in the arts. This will be realised through a tour of the exhibition Guernica Remakings, the formation of a Learning Lab that accompanies the exhibition and the distribution of the video documentation of the exhibition and the Lab.  The Learning Lab consciously creates a democratic environment that will foster discussion on art and social change, support the development of professional art practice through peer to peer collaboration and exchange with artists in residence, and expand the artistic networks of participating artists and Project Partners. Insights and best practice will permeate beyond participants to peers and related organisations, beneficiaries will grow exponentially through the dissemination of the documentary videos of the Learning Lab and the Guernica Remakings exhibition.   This project, Guernica Remakings, North with South, builds upon the AHRC funded research: Guernica Remakings, South Africa and continues work with the Project Partner the Keiskamma Art Project. Located in the Eastern Cape, in the poorest region of South Africa, the Art Project has remade Guernica four times since 2010. Their translation of Picasso's iconic anti-fascist artwork transforms its geography, time and narrative from: Spain to South Africa, from the early 20th century to the beginning of the 21st century, from anti-fascism to the HIV/AIDS crisis. The research project focused upon this process of cross-cultural translation through the creation of a fifth Keiskamma Guernica and asked why Guernica? Captured in the 12 part video documentary are some of the supportive, collaborative art making practices developed through the Art Project.

The project will create conditions for provision of quality health care services for more than 22,000 inhabitants of the Dbayeh Refugee Camp in Beirut. Thanks to the project implementation the capacity of a health centre located within the camp will be considerably expanded. The following results are expected: Result 1: Improved acces to health care services in Dbayeh refugee camp As a result of the implementation of the project at least 38 000 refugees are expected to be provided needed health care services in premises of a reconstructed and upgraded health center. The center could not be used up to the full capacity due to financial reasons and lack of staff and offered only a limited range of services for the camp inhabitants. More than 2 850 children (under the age of 5). Medical doctor and nurse will be employed and the health center will be regularly supplied with necessary medical equipment according to the patients'needs. Result 2: Access to vaccination in Dbayeh Camp After the reconstruction of the health center a vaccination department will be established. At least 570 children are expected to be enrolled in a vaccination program. Health center will be regularly supplied with necessary vaccines. Result 3: Improved nutrition of children in Dbayeh Camp A anti-malnutrition center will be established within the premises of the health center. It will be regularly supplied with milk and nutrition products based on the current needs and demand of children and their state of health. Cca 1,520 children are expected to be provided nutrition treatment and support. The following activities will take place in order to achieve the planned results of the project: • Reconstruction of the health center • Selection of employees (medical doctor, nurse) • Regular operation of the health center • Regular material and medicinal supply • Establishment of the vaccination center • Regular operation of the vaccination center • Establishment of anti-malnutrition center • Regular operation of anti-malnutrition center • Regular supply of anti-malnutrition products Implementation of the project will lead to improved health condition of refugess in the Dbayeh Camp. As a result, better access to health care services will have positive effect on their migration plans - many of them would be less willing to continue their migration to European countries once they are ensured access to quality health care services. The project also tackles one of the cross-cutting themes – protection of environment through introduction of medical waste recycling at the Dbayeh camp health center.",Basic health care,Yes,0.832732796669006

The activity is in support of the Agency's Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy and contributes to the Agency's objectives under Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths (EPCMD), and the Global Food Security Strategy (GFSS). The activity is part of the partnership USAID announced at the 2017 Global Nutrition Summit and builds on the Agency's strong history of investments in effective and scalable interventions that prevent and treat undernutrition. It will contribute to USAID's understanding of how to address poor nutrition in complex environments to strengthen resilience in areas of recurrent crises. Activities: Research will take place in the Karamoja region of Uganda, where chronic and acute malnutrition and food security remain a substantial challenge. ONCE will assess, monitor and evaluate an innovative multi-sectoral approach designed to reduce drivers of child malnutrition. Specifically, the activity will conduct formative research, program intervention and process monitoring, an impact evaluation, and a sustainability assessment. This research is innovative as it focuses on identifying implementation best practices to improve global understanding of how to implement high-quality, effective, sustainable, multi-sectoral programming in complex environments.

The project will strengthen the current health information systems and ensure that the necessary processes, tools and competences are in place for the generation, analysis and utilization of relevant, reliable and timely data and information to effectively inform health policies and programs focusing on maternal, child and adolescent health.Many countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region lack well-functioning information systems that can support health system strengthening. Key challenges include poor-quality data that does not align with decision-makers' needs, duplication, fragmentation and incomplete data, and poor utilization of data and information in decision-making and health systems strengthening. The project will adopt a multifaceted approach that will target all three domains of information system performance - technical, behavioral and institutional - to achieve sustainable improvements in data generation, analysis and use to inform health policies and practice.

2020005898-1,Access to drinking water and sanitation for the Sudanese refugee population of Chad,ACCESS TO DRINKING WATER AND SANITATION FOR THE SUDANESE REFUGEE POPULATION OF CHAD,"Título completo del proyecto: Acceso a agua potable y saneamiento para la población refugiada sudanesa del este del Chad :: El propósito del presente proyecto trata de contribuir al proceso de protección internacional de las personas refugiadas sudanesas en el este de Chad asegurando el acceso a los servicios básicos más esenciales, en este caso será conseguir que las personas refugiadas sudanesas en los campos gestionados por ACNUR en el este de Chad (Oure Cassoni, Touloum Amnaback, Mile, Iridimi y Kounoungou) y la población local chadiana de Amdjarass tengan acceso regular a servicios adecuados de agua con un suministro de calidad sin cortes de conformidad con los estándares internacionales y vivan en ambientes salubres evitándose de este modo la transmisión de enfermedades.CONTEXTO: Desde febrero de 2003 se están produciendo enfrentamientos en Darfur, al oeste de Sudán, entre milicias apoyadas por el Gobierno de Sudán y los grupos armados de oposición, la mayoría del grupo étnico Fur. La larga guerra civil sudanesa continúa teniendo consecuencias nefastas en la región de Darfur dando lugar a un enorme estado de volatilidad. En la actualidad residen en el este, 362.014 refugiados sudaneses.El Chad oriental se caracteriza por problemas de hundimiento de la capa freática, bombeo térmico, envejecimiento de la infraestructura y características técnicas que ya no satisfacen las necesidades de la situación actual. Las estructuras para movilizar las aguas superficiales para las interacciones transversales que pueden inducir mejores impactos son insuficientes. En la zona del este de Chad en concreto, 11 de los 12 campos tienen un promedio de 15L/p/d (cuando el estándar adecuado se encuentra en 20 litros por persona al día) con una producción diaria de 4718m3, para una necesidad de 6576m3.Las condiciones sanitarias e higiénicas en los campos son todavía precarias. La defecación al aire libre, que es alrededor del 15% según la encuesta CAP, es una gran preocupación. Sólo el 43% de los hogares tienen letrinas familiares en los 14 campos de refugiados del este de Chad, en comparación con un estándar del 85%. Esta tasa es de alrededor del 19% entre la población anfitriona. Para una necesidad de 665.577 letrinas para asegurar una cobertura del 85%, se cuenta sólo con 32.481 letrinas, lo que da una brecha de 33.096 letrinas. La corta vida útil de las letrinas familiares, la insuficiencia de las letrinas institucionales, la falta de conocimiento de las buenas prácticas de higiene, la mala gestión de los desechos domésticos y médicos, la ausencia de estructuras de gestión de las aguas de escorrentía y la lucha contra los vectores son grandes desafíos, ya que son focos de proliferación de vectores. La falta de infraestructura de gestión de los desechos y ciertos hábitos culturales y sociales constituyen una barrera para mejorar este componente.OBJETIVOS: El objetivo específico del proyecto es mejorar el acceso ininterrumpido a agua potable y a servicios adecuado",Basic drinking water supply and basic sanitation,Yes,0.800751566886902

This project will generate evidence to support effective, integrated and scalable early childhood development interventions for disadvantaged populations in low- and middle-income countries. The project will investigate how underprivileged and marginalized environments threaten the development of children and their families. It will identify factors that build resilience in the face of these threats, especially for those who are displaced or are refugees from conflict. It will develop and validate culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive and affordable interventions that will benefit a large number of children and families. The project will then assess the effectiveness of an integrated package of interventions in critical areas of child development in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya, that is home to internally and externally displaced families. It will examine the feasibility and affordability of the package of interventions and the cost of scaling up in the studied communities. The project will also build capacity in the science of early childhood development for frontline workers, researchers and leaders in policy and practice. This includes establishing a sustainable research and policy platform to share programs and practices globally, translating evidence into policy, and enabling expansion, replication and scale-up of effective interventions on the national, regional, and global levels. It will also strengthen the North-South partnership between two key institutions, the Aga Khan University and the Sinai Health System, to establish a well-recognized centre of excellence with the organizational and intellectual capacity to advance a more global science of early human development.The Nairobi project will be co-led by Aga Khan University's Institute of Human Development and the Sinai Health System.

The project works to improve the accessibility to GBV and psychosocial services in public health facilities and women-friendly spaces for survivors of GBV. Project activities include: (1) increasing awareness and use of services by survivors through outreach activities, (2) building the self-reliance skills of 4,000 women with information on their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), functional numeracy and literacy skills, nutrition and core life skills, (3) engaging 30,000 community members through implementing, for the first time in Bangladesh, the SASA! (Start, Awareness, Support, Action) community mobilization strategy for raising awareness and preventing GBV, and (4) developing a community-based GBV response and prevention program, including engagement with men and boys for their role in protecting families and communities from GBV. Benefiting over 500,000 women and girls, the project supports the Bangladeshi Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in: (1) strengthening public health facilities to provide high-quality midwifery and emergency obstetric care, (2) increasing the availability of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) services, including family planning, contraception and treatment of STIs and HIV, and (3) developing training materials and providing training for health care providers on GBV response and treatment of survivors. / Le projet vise à fournir des soins de santé sexuelle et reproductive équitables et à lutter contre la violence basée sur le genre (VBG) pour les personnes vivant dans les communautés locales de Cox's Bazar touchées par l'afflux de plus de 740 000 réfugiés rohingyas depuis août 2017. Cox's Bazar est l'un des districts les plus pauvres et les plus vulnérables du Bangladesh, avec une pauvreté bien supérieure à la moyenne nationale. L'afflux de Rohingyas a accru les tensions économiques et la concurrence pour des ressources rares, y compris les emplois et les revenus parmi les Rohingyas et les communautés locales où les réfugiés sont installés, et a eu un impact sérieux sur les infrastructures et services locaux.

2020200023,Quality laboratory testing -training project in Benin,QUALITY LABORATORY TESTING -TRAINING PROJECT IN BENIN,Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a serious fast-growing global problem threatening effectiveness of antibiotic treatment of infectious diseases. Detection of resistant pathogenic bacteria is crucial to prevention of their spread. In Benin clinical laboratories cannot fulfill this task due to poor infrastructure and lack of skills of laboratory personnel. Furthermore physicians' understanding of  utilization of laboratory results in their treatment decisions is weak. Therefore we propose a capacity building project which aims to strengthen clinical laboratories in Benin concentrating especially in antimicrobial resistance testing and detection of resistant bacteria that cause potentially mortal blood infections including sepsis. We emphasize quality control practices that ensure as short as possible turn-around time and reliability of results. This is essential for all testing activities of clinical laboratories also in facing epidemics such as the recent Covid-19.   In our project PSR will support Beninese partners to carry out training of trainers for AMR and blood infections testing. In a training laboratory affiliated with the University of Abomey-Calavi a set of master trainers will be educated with the help of local and Finnish clinical laboratory experts. These master trainers will further train clinical laboratory technicians from all the regions of Benin invited to attend by the Beninese Ministry of Health. Altogether 60 laboratory staff will be trained and certified. Workshops bringing together physicians and laboratory experts will be arranged to design new practices facilitating efficient utilization of laboratory results in treatment of infections and reducing AMR. Evidence is collected on laboratory practices before and after the training to produce information on efficacy of provided training and to propose further paths for improving clinical laboratories and in tackling AMR.

2020006369,Inserting Ethics into Deliberation on Adaptation and Resilience Policy,INSERTING ETHICS INTO DELIBERATION ON ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE POLICY,"This follow-up project aims to integrate into adaptation and resilience policy-making some of the lessons gained through the Why We Disagree About Development (WhyDAR) research project (NE/P01609X/1). WhyDAR aimed to identify different ways in which urban resilience is understood while investigating the role of science, technology, ethics and expertise in the making of resilience strategies in the Global South. It drew out key ethical questions arising from disagreement about conceptions to resilience, and asked what an equitable approach to resilience would look like in the face of this disagreement.   Aiming to integrate these lessons into real-life adaptation and resilience policy, this project will work together with the climate adaptation team at the municipal level in Cape Town, South Africa (upper middle income). South Africa is likely to experience - and, in some cases, have already experienced - the negative effects of climate change, such as droughts and floodings. Unfortunately, access to resilient infrastructures, including housing, health care, and food chains, and representative institutions is highly unequal, inequitable, and inadequate within South Africa. Consequently, especially the poorest and most vulnerable community members are often left out and underrepresented within resilience and adaptation strategies, threatening their lives, health, food security, livelihoods, well-being, and access to crucial services, such as water and energy supply. This situation raises ethical issues of how adaptation and resilience planning within the most climate vulnerable LMICs can become more equal, equitable, and representative of those who are most in need of inclusion, including taking into account the fact that different stakeholders have different conceptions of and aims for resilience.   Working together with the municipal climate adaptation team of Cape Town, the project will develop and implement three procedural methodologies for inserting ethical deliberations into adaptation and resilience planning and policy-making at the local and municipal level:   (i) Stakeholder dialogues bring together representatives of different affected groups, including policy-makers, city council members, service providers, NGOs, businesses, and not members of the local communities. Through dialogue, deliberators will be forced to take into account the interests of other groups, explain and provide justification for their own views.  (ii) Scenario building exercises will encourage deliberators to reflect on the ethical aspects of different resilience scenarios and how they may be resolved. In particular, we will try out an exercise in which the deliberators will be behind a 'veil of ignorance' when considering a scenario and will not know what identity they have within it. Only afterwards will their identities be revealed to them and they will then evaluate whether the solutions that they came up with behind the veil were really fair to all stakeholders",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.733351945877075

This project supports the participatory development of an electronic harmonized reproductive health registry (hRHR). This network is expected to link timely and accurate health data from local primary care health centres to hospital settings and governorate-level planning bodies, and then back to communities in the Mafraq governorate of Jordan. Given the high number of Syrian refugees in the Mafraq governorate, the registry will be designed to serve both refugee and non-refugee populations to address the different health needs and social contexts of the various groups. More specifically, the project will analyze existing systems and tools of sexual and reproductive health data collection and use, develop a harmonized electronic registry system using participatory approaches and established guidelines from the World Health Organization, strengthen representation of underserved groups of women, men, and youth in stakeholder meetings and governance processes, develop a dashboard of data and related analysis, assess the quality, timeliness, and reliability of data, and build the capacities of researchers and decision-makers. The main outcomes include improved quality and timeliness of reproductive health data, better integration and inter-operability among different health facilities, a strengthened referral system, increased capacities by decision-makers and providers to use health data, and costed plans to scale up the hRHR effort to other parts of the country.  This project represents one of nine spanning two regions (West Africa and the Middle East) and two thematic topics (adolescent sexual and reproductive health and health information systems). The project is closely aligned with the Government of Canada's new Feminist International Assistance Policy, the strategic priorities detailed in the 2016-2030 WHO led Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescents, and the overarching 2030 global agenda for sustainable development.

Over 90% of the inhabitants make their living by way of traditional agriculture and fishing. The average income level is estimated to be $89/person ($290/person Tanzania as a whole). Due to this, TCRS has included the Kilwa area as part of its community empowerment program. Expected development effects: decreased poverty and sustainable development as a result of growth in target group capacity in the target area. Outcome of activities (i) improved status of women and girls, hiv positive and disabled people, (ii) sufficient livelihood of marginalized and those in danger of becoming marginalized, (iii) participation by project community members in decision making and self-motivated development of their communities, and (iv) transpartent, responsible, and democratic leadership, and good governance in the villages. Activities benefit 1816 direct beneficiaries in 10 rural villages of Kilwa (642W, 681M, 180G, 313B, including 410 disabled people) and 327 bearers of responsibility (122W, 205M). In addition to the direct beneficiaries, the projects sphere of influence includes 9517 individuals (4958W, 4559M). Target groups are children and youth in danger of becoming marginalized, disabled people, women, girls, victims of economic, sexual, and physical abuse, traditional leaders, religious leaders, civil servants, political decision makers and key individuals of organizations. The project is implemented by Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS), which is an experienced and knowledgable actor in working with those living in extreme poverty and refugees, and is competent in a human rights based approach in village communities. The organizations approach works because it activates the villagers to act as their knowledge and skills accumulate. For example, small entrepreneurship is central in improving the situation of those living in extreme poverty, and TCRS has much experience in steering towards this. Administrative ability of the organization in strong, and professionality of the employees high.

These risks are especially challenging for poor rural women and children, who suffer even more from hunger, food insecurity, and a lack of adequate health services. Since these risks differ across agro-ecosystems in the country, it is crucial that adaptation measures recognize the value of targeted, location-specific, community-based strategies and processes.

This project builds on lessons from these methodological, institutional, and model-building research efforts leveraging the linkages between agriculture, climate change, and nutrition. The goal of this project is to identify and scale optimal climate-smart agriculture practices and interventions suitable for the four major agro-ecological regions of Myanmar: the central dry zone, the mountain uplands, the upland-plateau, and the delta. Using participatory research methods, the study, implemented by the New York City-based International Institute for Rural Reconstruction, will assess a portfolio of low-cost technologies and interventions in selected locations that serve as Climate Smart Villages.

2020006839,Scaling up Off-Grid Sanitation,SCALING UP OFF-GRID SANITATION,"To protect human health and the environment, sanitation systems must separate people from their excreta and treat it. This does not just involve technologies but other aspects like finance, government policies and human behaviours must be considered.   Sewers and wastewater treatment plants can assist in providing safe sanitation, but they are expensive and challenging to build, particularly in dense urban areas or where people do not own the land that they live on. In fact, only 45% of the world's urban population have safely managed sanitation, that is where human waste is treated before disposal. Many of these people are instead using off-grid options for sanitation, such as pit latrines and septic tanks. These are physically difficult to empty, especially in areas of high population density, on steep slopes or with a high water table, and pose significant health hazards. The collected waste is often dumped illegally, frequently into water sources. Off grid solutions can only manage waste safely if the waste collection, treatment and disposal is properly considered.   This research will focus on an emerging off-grid sanitation option in the form of container-based sanitation (CBS) across four city contexts where the provision and regulation of CBS is done by different organisations.   In Cap Haitien (Haiti), CBS is provided by an NGO, in Lima (Peru) it is provided by a private company, in Cape Town (South Africa) it is provided by the municipality and in Kakuma Refugee camp (Kenya) it is provided by a private company working with an NGO.    A refugee camp is included as in the future, refugees driven by climate and other factors will make up a significant proportion of the world's urban population.  Interviews will be conducted with the staff working for the CBS provider as well as other organisations that they work closely with, e.g., local government, water utilities and regulators.   To capture the feelings and opinions of the people using the CBS toilets, as well as people using other off-grid sanitation options like pit latrines, a novel smartphone data collection will be used. Participants will complete a short survey several times a week to capture aspects of their mental well-being.  In addition, the data collected will reveal whether current regulations and policies support CBS and whether CBS increases disparities or decreases them.   For example, does CBS without a permanent infrastructure make users feel more vulnerable to eviction, and is the collection of the containers a burden?   Or does it give access to people who would not otherwise be able to use a toilet?  The project will also look at the links with other sectors, specifically waste, energy, transport and solid waste, as if CBS coverage is increased these services will be impacted.   For example CBS relies on road transport and cause additional traffic.   But the use of CBS stops the disposal of waste into rivers so water supplies are cleaner.

2018181632,F.a: Kishapu Climate Change Adaptation Programme,F.A: KISHAPU CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION PROGRAMME,"The Kishapu area is one of the poorest of Tanzania. A challenge is the shortage of potable water. The situation has deteriorated as the local climate becomes drier. Reasons are increased firewood usage due to population increase, and traditional farming methods. This has transformed the area into semi-desert in many places. Chemicals harmful to health have polluted ground water. A new challenge is rainfall unpredictability brought about by climate change, which weakens food security. The project, part of the TCRS village community empowerment program, supports the population in the area in adapting to the change in their habitat and in prevention of desertification. Expected long-term effects: members of village communities within project sphere of influence actively participate in the development of their villages taking into consideration environmental impacts. Results of activities (i) improved status of women and girls, youth, hiv-positive and disbled individuals, (ii) improved availability of clean drinking water, (iii) functioning hygiene and sanitary solutions in schools and homes, (iv)  members of village communities in project villages participate in decision making and development of their communities with regard to environmental impacts, (v) behaviour of households is modified to be more environmentally friendly, (vi) transparent, responsible, and democratic leadership in project villages. The Kishapu project area covers 14 villages, and the education project includes 8 313 beneficiaries (3039W, 1671M, 2091G, 1512B, including 213 disabled individuals) and 504 (139W, 365M) bearers of responsibility. Additionaly there are 31 613 indirect beneficiaries. The target groups are children and youth in danger of becoming marginalized, disabled people, women, girls, victims of financial, sexual, and physical abuse, civil servants, political decision makers, and key individuals of organizations. The project is implemented by Tanganyika Christian Refugee Service (TCRS). Their area of expertise includes the problems of refugees and those living in extreme poverty and human rights based approach in village communities. They activate villagers to act as they accumulate knowledge and skills. Administrative competence of the organization is strong, and professional skills of its employees is high.

The women will first be engaged in public-works to rehabilitate and/or climate proof critical local infrastructure for which they receive a small, predictable, fortnightly, salary during a period of six months. A part of the remuneration is set aside in compulsory savings which the women will access as a lump-sum at the end of the public-works period to allow them to, for example start their own small-scale businesses. They will also be trained in various life-skills as well as skills relevant for future employments, enhancing their networks and contributing to personal dignity. Assistance will also be provided to access digital financial services and insurance schemes. The idea is that their increased income combined with life and employability skills and enhance self-esteem will help beneficiaries invest productively to ensure a stream of income in years to come.

Under a new core policy action, SSC completed a comprehensive analysis of a strategic development and sector road map for 2010 to 2020 to address market infrastructure bottlenecks for capital market growth. To address accounting standards, the government initiated a gap assessment to more closely align Vietnamese accounting standards with the IAS and developed an implementation timeline. To enhance market information standards, the draft Law on Independent Audit was submitted to the government. To enhance information disclosure, the Vietnam Securities Depository (VSD) completed the pilot implementation of the automatic synchronization of records between its head office and branches for public companies registered with VSD. To strengthen VSD s risk management capacity, a risk assessment of its central depository and clearing functions benchmarked against international practices will be undertaken.Output 2: Strengthened institutional framework for securities issuance. To develop the government securities market, the program supports institutional reforms such as the establishment of Public Debt Management Office (PDMO). Together with the Banking and Financial Institutions Department of MOF, PDMO will provide an institutional focal point to support a range of key reforms in the bond markets. To improve the risk management and the operating efficiency of the money market, and open market operations for the development of a liquid secondary market, SBV will incorporate the short-term risk mitigation measures identified in the ADB TA report.Output 3: Enhanced legal and regulatory framework for investor and consumer protection and financial sector stability.

The majority of the inhabitants of the region rely on climate-sensitive economic activities and depend on natural resources for their livelihoods (UNDP 2011). Frontier communities in Guinea, Mali and Senegal are particularly prone to the effects of long and short-term environmental shocks and stresses, which can have significant negative repercussions for their subsistence activities. However, putting the emphasis on their fragility, precarity and susceptibility to extreme climate events without acknowledging their important and long-standing resilience building strategies in the face of recurrent environmental stresses misses the opportunity to realise their potential to drive transformative adaptation and to open up new pathways for sustainable development. Despite there being ample evidence showing the important role of local repertoires of knowledge in building resilience capacity before and after climate related shocks and stresses, these rich repertoires have often been devalued or ignored in the design of climate change and sustainable development programs and projects.   The overall aim therefore, of this project is to help re-centre the resilience thinking and practice in climate change adaptation policy back in local actors and communities themselves and enhance the efforts geared to achieve a more equitable sustainable development in West Africa by de-marginalising frontier communities in Senegal (Casamance), Mali (Kayes) and Guinea (Upper-Guinea). The project will focus on the longue-durée resilience strategies of populations particularly at risk (women and descendants of formerly enslaved populations). It will aim to facilitate their involvement and leadership in community-based resilience action planning and organisational learning, and integrate their experiences and knowledges across multiple scales for long-lasting development gains.  Our project team brings together a unique combination of expertise in African history, social anthropology and literary studies, which are less common in development approaches. It aims at constructing a synergistic approach with transformative and catalyst effect by collecting local knowledge that can be harnessed for development activities located at the intersections between poverty, environmental sustainability, governance and vulnerability. The transformative aspect of this research relies on building knowledge networks across borders between frontier communities' stakeholders who otherwise would have little chance to connect and to share and compare their experiences and local knowledge. This cross-border knowledge networks will be facilitated by the organisation in partnership with the organisation Donkosira of training workshops with all stakeholders in each case study country, and the dev",Research/scientific institutions,Yes,0.557551383972168

The greatest increases in non-communicable diseases are seen in low- and middle-income countries now experiencing epidemics of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Outdoor and indoor air pollution combined account for around 7 million of these deaths, predominantly in developing countries of Asia, particularly India and China. Environmental pollution affects everyone in society creating a heavy burden on quality of life, productivity and school performance. The underprivileged, including female and children, living and working in polluted environments are more at risk and unable to avoid exposure. Greenhouse gases emitted from the same sources (e.g. motorised transport, waste burning) have an impact on climate, increasing the risk of extreme weather events such as floods and heatwaves. Asian countries are urbanising rapidly and unsustainably, locking their populations in polluting behaviours through inefficient land use planning and poorly designed transport and housing infrastructure. Environmental pollution is a drain on development, disproportionately affecting underprivileged communities, for example those living in informal settlements, and vulnerable individuals, for example those with respiratory illness. For too long the relationship between prosperity and environment has been seen as a trade-off.  Tackling pollution was considered a handicap to economic growth. Growing evidence now shows sustainable development can help improve not only health and the environment, but also the economy.  The drive towards cleaner environments and low carbon development, provides a compelling opportunity to realise multiple societal benefits: to improve health and the environment, innovate and become more competitive. To address the huge development challenge of environmental pollution and non-communicable diseases in Asia, and harness opportunities provided by sustainable development, we propose the engagement network on Clean Environment and Planetary Health in Asia (CEPHA): to catalyse technological and societal innovation through deep engagement across disciplines and sectors that will stimulate transformative changes to business models, government policies and public health practice in Asia. Network outcomes will include long-lasting partnerships, enhanced knowledge exchange and capacity building, and co-creation of projects and resources focusing on actionable solutions to the challenges of improving the environment, decarbonising the economy, and reducing the burden on non-communicable diseases in Asia.

Simultáneamente, España, potencia colonizadora del Sahara Occidental, abandona el Territorio. El Pueblo Saharaui, por ello, se ve obligado a huir hasta cruzar la frontera de Argelia, país que les presta apoyo, acogiéndoles y permitiéndoles vivir en ?la Hamada?, la Zona más inhóspita del desierto argelino. En 1976, los saharauis proclaman la República Árabe Saharaui Democrática (RASD). Así, mientras los hombres en el Frente libran una guerra por la liberación de su Territorio, las mujeres son las encargadas de establecer, organizar, gestionar y mantener los actuales Campamentos de Población Refugiada, donde se asientan.

2020006791,GCRF Mine Dust and Health Network,GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK,"GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK SUMMARY While the mining industry contributes significantly to the economies of developing countries around the world, mining activities have notable negative environmental and health impacts. Among these, the dust emitted by mining and its associated operations is a cause of increasing concern. Apart from impacting the health of mine-workers who breathe in mineral dust particles, dust is emitted from open pit mines, ore processing and metal extraction plants, ore stockpiles, ore transport containers and mine waste deposits, impacting the wider environment and communities. Lung diseases caused or exacerbated by mine dust exposure include silicosis (caused by inhaling quartz or crystalline silica), black lung disease (caused by inhaling coal dust) and tuberculosis (silica dust exposure increases the risk of pulmonary TB, particularly in gold miners). This places a huge burden on already-strained public health and social security systems. Occupational health hazards from mining are well documented, and the link between dust and lung disease was recently recognised in a class action lawsuit against the six main mining houses in South Africa, awarded in favour of mine workers who contracted silicosis and TB working on gold mines between March 1965 and May 2018 (https://www.silicosissettlement.co.za/). However, the health effects associated with environmental dust emissions, although frequently a concern expressed by communities and community support organisations, have not been rigorously studied. Meaningful data is needed to inform what strategies and policies will work best to mitigate the effects of mine dust on communities living near mines and mine dumps, the populations of which number in their millions. Gathering such data is not simple, however. There are many complexities involved, with dust sources and their effects being influenced by inter-related factors covering the health, economic, social, geological, environmental, engineering, management, and political spheres. The issues associated with mine dust are also frequently contentious and involve diverse stakeholders and interested and affected parties with different, and often conflicting priorities. Poor engagement and communication between experts and lay persons, disciplinary silos and polarised viewpoints have made it difficult to develop a holistic understanding of the complex health issues associated with environmental emissions of mine dusts, and consequently to design meaningful and integrated approaches to address such issues. It is these challenges that our GCRF MINE DUST AND HEALTH NETWORK will seek to address by bringing together researchers, stakeholders and practitioners from a variety of disciplines and professional backgrounds to identify sources, challenges and potential mitigation opportunities associated with public health effects from dust pollution arising from mining activities. Focus will be on integrating and sharing knowledge and",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.473156452178955

Overall poverty rates average about 27%, but are considerably higher in more isolated areas, where poverty levels may be 50%-60%. One of the main reasons for these high levels of poverty is limited access to productive assets and infrastructure (such as irrigation water systems), and physical isolation. The project will focus on improving small- to medium-scale irrigation and/ordrainage systems, rural roads, and district and commune markets. The project will include 40-45 subprojects.

Adverse effects of climate change, including changes in seasonal rainfall and increased frequency and intensity of floods, landslides, and soil erosion are amplifying the vulnerabilities of the Basin's 120 million people, who are reliant on rain-fed agriculture. This is especially true for women, who account for more than 73% of the people who derive their livelihoods from agriculture and who produce more than 80% of the region's food crops. There is also speculation that climate change leads to or exacerbates conflicts within the Congo Basin due to increased pressure on resources. The usual human mobility trends have recently been replaced by new patterns of pastoralist migration from northern regions to access the basin's arable land, pasture, and water resources, resulting in new kinds of conflicts. These interlinked challenges threaten livelihoods, increase competition, intensify divisions and ethnic tension, reduce state capability and legitimacy, and trigger poorly designed climate action. Empirical research to obtain up-to-date hydro-climatic and socioeconomic information is needed to address climate and water-driven migration, conflict interlinkages, and their implications for the basin's population.  This project will involve quantitative and qualitative research and training activities for key stakeholders in the northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The field research will target communities of pastoralists, farmers, fishers, Indigenous peoples and migrants. The project activities will guide the identification and assessment of gender-specific climate adaptation and conflict resolution strategies such as water preservation, water use sharing, access to potable water, income generation, food security, and livelihoods. This is expected to directly benefit an estimated 600 people, of which approximately 60% are women. The project is expected to contribute to the implementation of the DRC's National Strategic Plan for Development that was adopted in 2017 and calls for protection of the environment, access to water and sanitation, and adaptation to climate change for a better quality of life.",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.383118212223053

Los refugiados enfrentan una serie de restricciones que afectan a su calidad de vida: los espacios son reducidos, la movilidad está restringida y vigilada (el toque de queda rige los campos y a las siete de la tarde deben estar de regreso en ellos), las instalaciones educativas son inadecuadas, hay dificultad de acceso a los servicios públicos ante la negativa del estado indio de reconocerles como refugiados, poca privacidad, y escasa higiene, pobre saneamiento y falta de oportunidades de obtener ingresos mínimos ante la discriminación laboral que sufren. En este contexto son las mujeres y las niñas quienes viven una vulnerabilidad mayor en los campos, ya que éstos están dominados por hombres que perpetúan la desigualdad de género: acoso sexual, violencia, falta de oportunidades laborales, desconocimiento del idioma local, matrimonios concertados, abandono escolar etc. Adicionalmente, ante el COVID-19 hay 3 condiciones que empeoran su situación y ante las cuales urge poner en marcha iniciativas: malas condiciones de salubridad, falta de ayudas y limitación a la atención de salud.Así pues la población beneficiaria del proyecto son 350 mujeres refugiadas tamiles de entre 16 y 40 años, que no han terminado sus estudios y que han quedado privadas de oportunidades de desarrollo personal y profesional.

WLP's mission is to transform power relations and promote justice, equality, peace, and sustainable development by strengthening the feminist movement. This is done through curriculum and resource development, training, capacity development, advocacy and movement building while promoting and sustaining leadership that is participatory and replicable. WLP's overall objective is to empower women to become active citizens and effective participatory leaders and to build communities of shared values of social and political change to achieve legal equality, economic justice, security and political participation through advocacy and movement building. Sida has funded WLP with core support from 2015. Through curriculum development, training, civil society strengthening, women's human rights advocacy and movement building, WLP has expanded partners' international, regional, and local leadership, raised public awareness on democracy and women's rights, strengthened democratic development and political participation by training more than 22,000 emerging leaders, and achieved commendable results through partners' advocacy and activism. WLP submitted an application to Sida for core support of 36 000 000 SEK for a four-year time-frame (2018-2022) on 27 March, 2018. The intervention will focus on capacity development of its partners, women and girls through training programs, produce and promote feminist research from the Global South, participate in and support women's organisations' advocacy and networking activities, preserve women's movement history though documentation of the women's movement, and expand WLP's international outreach for long-term sustainability. Additionally, WLP will expand its program in four new directions in response to external factors shaping the rights of women globally: i) empowering refugee women, ii) reforming family law, iii) promoting human security, and iv) strengthening the capacity of women's civil society organisations.The intervention's total budget for 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2022 is approximately 90 000 000 SEK, out of which WLP has secured funding of approximately 5 870 000 SEK (663 000 USD). Several of WLP's donors provide short term support which is expected to be renewed on a yearly basis. The support from Sida accounts for approximately 40% of the organization's total budget during the 4 year intervention period.","Women's rights organisations and movements, and government institutions",Review,0.312280297279358

En concret es pretén proveir el Programa Nacional de Salut Reproductiva (PNSR) del Ministeri de Salut Pública (MSP) sahrauí dels medicaments essencials i material sanitari fungible necessari per tal de millorar la qualitat dels serveis de ginecologia i obstetrícia que ofereixen les llevadores i auxiliars dels Campaments de Refugiats Sahrauís situats a Tinduf (Algèria). Aquest personal sanitari atèn entre 5.200 i 5.500 parts anuals, en condicions moltes vegades de precarietat de materials, i amb condicionants de salut específics fruit del context geogràfic i polític. Així mateix, atès que la pandèmia de Covid19 també afecta els campaments sahrauís i que existeix una cobertura del tot insuficient de material de protecció degut a les dificultats de proveïment, el projecte es proposa atendre aquesta necessitat expressada mitjançant el proveïment de material al personal sanitari del PNSR (mascaretes, equipaments de protecció, desinfectants). El projecte inclou un element d'EpD com és la sensibilització a Catalunya, i especialment al sector sanitari català, sobre les dificultats i barreres existents per a l'exercici del dret a la salut reproductiva de les dones sahrauís en els campaments de refugiats, i el context en que les llevadores duen a terme la seva tasca assistencial alhora que treballen per apoderar-se i dignificar la seva professió en el marc de les estructures tradicionals del Ministeri de Salut Pública. Per a complir amb aquest objectiu, es convidarà la directora del PNSR i la cap de l'Oficina Central de Llevadores a Catalunya per a dur a terme un seguit de trobades i xerrades dirigides a sensibilitzar però també a incidir políticament en un major suport a la seva tasca.

2020006736,TERSE: Techno-Economic framework for Resilient and Sustainable Electrification,TERSE: TECHNO-ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK FOR RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE ELECTRIFICATION,"Rural electrification is fundamental for the social and economic development and well-being of developing countries, as it supports the development of vital critical infrastructures (e.g. communication and transportation) and it provides energy to critical services to peoples' quality of everyday life, such as home appliances, health and water supply. The lack or limited and highly unreliable access to electricity still remains one of the key challenges that rural and remote communities face in these countries. In order though for the electrification to go beyond lightning, it is critical to develop energy networks that are sustainable, cost-effective, and scalable, as well as resilient, particularly in areas that are frequently exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, monsoons, etc.       In this context, the ambition of this project is to develop a novel holistic techno-economic framework for supporting and enabling the decision, policy and regulatory making towards the design of transformative energy networks in developing countries. This holistic framework will be supported by the development of an options portfolio for sustainable electrification, including a mixture of infrastructure solutions (e.g. building new or upgrading existing infrastructure) and emerging low-carbon distributed energy resources that will focus on the development of sustainable microgrids (both grid-connected and off-grid). Further, integrated system simulation models will be developed to analyse the vulnerability and quantify the risk and resilience profile of these energy solutions to natural hazards and extreme weather. This is is highly timely given the latest evidence of the impact of such events worldwide and also highly critical if the rural communities are to withstand and quickly recover from such catastrophic events. Following these analyses, stochastic optimization planning techniques will be developed to support the optimal design of these energy networks, considering transformative energy technologies, to maximize the impact on the well-being of local communities.  Building on this last point, the research team has developed a well-structured user-engagement strategy, bridging to wider socio-economic aspects of communities facing electrification challenges. The aims of this strategy are to get an in-depth understanding of the electricity needs of rural communities in the partner countries (China and Malaysia), enable their active role in the project and provide briefing and training sessions on the use of the new energy technologies to be applied in these communities. The UK and overseas research teams will jointly work with the local industrial partners to facilitate this active involvement of remote villages, communities and their local authorities.   This project will aim to complement and further strengthen the current electrification plans of the partner countries, i.e. Malaysia and China.

The document will encompass primarily the environmental strategies and action plans for the FBiH, RS and BD, but also actions needed to be implemented at BiH level (e.g. horizontal issues and follow-up of BiH ESAP). The BiH ESAP will be a strategy that will identify in a bottom-up way shared strategic environmental goals and principles for BiH, as well as thematic goals and targets, and feasible measures and activities from all three administrative levels aligned to the sub-themes of the EU environmental acquis. The BiH ESAP will include cost estimates of proposed measures and activities to reach the strategic goals at BiH, entity, and district levels, which will guide prioritisation of domestic and international investments. This strategic document will thus provide a long-term planning framework, allowing for best practices and actions to be more consistent across the country, facilitate monitoring and reporting of the set goals and targets, as well as to monitor progress of the EU approximation process.The expected long-term impacts of this Project is to improve the state of the environment in BiH and progress in the process of BiH approximation to the EU. Consequently, project will contribute to improving country's resilience to natural disasters.The implementing partner, the Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) will have full responsibility for overall contract performance, finances and expenditure, and reports directly to the Embassy/Sida.

The strategy is spearheaded by such urban development schemes as the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and its subcomponent the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns. Apart from supporting the Government's priority of planned development of urban centers in the country, the Investment Program is also aligned with the objectives of fostering economic growth and reducing poverty in Rajasthan. The fast growing sectors in Rajasthan are mostly in urban areas, where productivity is 3.5 times higher than in rural areas. The emphasis on urban development in Rajasthan, financial reforms and the passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act in 1992, which laid the basis for decentralization in the urban sector, have made some improvements, but large inefficiencies in service delivery, low investment in wider service coverage, and poor maintenance persist.The Investment Program and its road map are guided by the 10th FYP 2002-2007 and 11th FYP 2007-2012 of the Government of India.

These services are selected because they represent the most fundamental needs of urban populations and are the focus of SDG 6 (water and sanitation) and SDG 7 (energy). Our work will support the achievement of SDG 11 (sustainable communities and cities). The research will be undertaken in Freetown, Sierra Leone and Kampala, Uganda. The population in both these cities is growing rapidly, with significant levels of poverty and significant numbers of informal settlements. Current rates of access to water supply, sanitation and energy are low in these cities, with striking inequalities in access to these services between wealthy and poor areas. The rapid increase in population has led to communities being established that are distant from existing infrastructure and difficult to serve. Households in marginalised communities therefore have to access water, sanitation and energy from informal and often 'off-grid' sources. This includes, for instance, using charcoal for energy, dug wells or protected springs for domestic water and basic on-site sanitation.  Our research will combine social, economic and political analysis with insights from natural and engineering science to understand how the infrastructure, management, finance and governance can be developed to improve water, sanitation and energy services. Our research is designed in five inter-related work areas. We will first establish a thorough understanding of each city. We will analyse how the cities have developed to date and how they are likely to develop in the future, we will identify which areas have access to formal services and which have access to informal services, and will we map the hazards and risks in each city. We will use data collected from official statistics to analyse each city and in Freetown we will use remotely sensed data from NASA to map the city.  We will then assess the formal on-grid services, using data key attributes of the infrastructure to develop risk maps. We will research the attitudes of suppliers, policy makers and city officials regarding the challenges and opportunities to extend services to people who don't currently have access. We will complement this by looking at how informal suppliers provide services, including the technologies they use and their business models. We will assess the resilience of the services and research the perceptions of the informal suppliers about how services can be improved and what they see as being their role in this. Next we will work in four marginalised communities to understand how and from where they currently access services, how much they pay and their perception of the quality of services. We will explore what people living communities think would be the best way to improve services and who they think should provide services.  We will use all the data we have collected abou",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.187566697597504

More than 8 million Syrians currently live abroad (more than 1 million in Europe). Today, prospects for a swift, safe and voluntary return to Syria as well as for a safe space for civil society within Syria are rapidly fading, forcing civil society actors to rethink their engagement as a civil society in exile. Thus, they see and voice the need to (i) become better organized in their host countries and to (ii) seek collaboration between civil society organizations (CSO) in Syria's neighboring countries and the CSO in Europe in order to get their voices heard and contribute to a better future for Syrians inside and outside Syria. Europe is currently the safest space for dialogue for the Syrian CSO and Diaspora as well as a key location for advocacy towards the UN, EU, and EU's member states, making it a fertile hub for those organizations. The present project aims at supporting Syrian-led activities in Europe by (i) fostering cooperation between Syrian CSO and Diaspora networks in Europe and (ii) empowering Syrian umbrella organizations in Europe to start dialogues for Syrians in the Diaspora on their role in their host country and towards Syria.

Ethiopia, with Uganda, is hosting the largest number of registered refugee population in Africa. The project will target both South Sudanese refugees and host communities living in the areas surrounding the camps. South Sudanese refugees have been placed in Gambella Region, located in the South West of the country and bordering South Sudan, against a local population totalling some 310,000 people, of whom approximately 45% are Nuer and 22% Anuak, Gambella hosts more than 350,000 South Sudanese refugees, most of them Nuer, placed in 7 camps. Literacy level is exceptionally low among the South Sudanese, the average literacy rate being 27% (female literacy rate is 16%, and male 40%). This is reflected in UNHCR data from the camps in Gambella, according to which more than 70% of the whole South Sudanese refugee population is uneducated. Similarly, illiteracy is very high also among the local population in Gambela, reaching 54% in the population of 15  60 year olds (40% among males and 66% females). Since the majority of the population in Gambella is Nuer as South Sudanese refugees, FRC intervention on functional literacy will target equally refugees and host communities. The objective of the project is that through an inclusive approach, refugees and host communities in Ethiopia have enhanced their capacity to anticipate, manage, and recover from shocks (resilience) and their mutual relationship (social cohesion) has improved. The outcome of the project is that adult South Sudanese refugees in camps and host communities living nearby are empowered by the acquisition of functional literacy and life skills.

While the extension takes the form of a no-cost extension to allow existing donors not yet ready to commit new funds to remain engaged, the intention is also to enable CIWA to raise funds to reach its initially set target of USD 200 million. The Fund's current total value is  USD 93 million, 35 308 689 of which (or 284 million SEK) have been contributed by Sweden since 2012. Sweden has support the fund since its inception in 2012 and one decsion on contribution and two decisions to add funds have been taken.  Other donors include the Netherlands, the UK, The EU, Denmark and Norway. To date, almost all funds paid into CIWA have been allocated to pipeline, hence planning of new activities will depend on new resources coming in to the fund. The Netherlands recently announced that it will be appraising an additional contribution of USD 20 million in the latter half of 2018 and the WB is also fund-raising with new donors.The current agreement amendment will increase Sida's support to CIWA with another 100 MSEK to a total of 384 MSEK and extend the support to 2026. The funding is channeled through a World Bank Multi Donor Trust Fund (MDTF), of which 75% is recipient executed and 25% is executed by the World Bank, but according to the Trust Fund Assurance Framework 3013 all funds must be programmed according to World Bank guidelines.CIWA was established for a 10-year period (2011-21). An independent mid-term review of the program in 2015 found that CIWA's objectives remained highly relevant, its basic operational approach was sound, and made several specific recommendations to strengthen the program, which are now largely implemented. Sweden has supported CIWA since 2012, and has over the years seen the program deliver good results. The program seems to be on target or over performing against most of its intermediate level indicators. It has a good fit with the Swedish Strategy for SSA, and Sida is therefore interested in CIWA's possibility to continue and expand operation. CIWA's objective is to strengthen cooperative water resources management and development to enable sustainable, climate resilient economic growth in Africa. CIWA helps countries take advantage of opportunities as it advances investments in basin-wide information systems, in institutions for cooperation and coordination or in infrastructure with transboundary impact that can store surplus waters, protect against floods, generate hydropower, promote food security, and enhance resilience in the face of climate change. CIWA also assist riparian States to manage risk as it promotes countries' awareness of their interdependencies and helps them strike a better balance in their decision-making between sovereign and collective considerations.

Extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, are expected to further complicate the operation of water-supply, drainage, and sewerage infrastructure, making good solid waste management an important ingredient of climate resilience. Good solid waste management involves reducing volumes, improving collection, investing in drainage, replacing riverside and wetland dumping with engineered landfills, and identifying sustainable mechanisms to finance waste management. Research is needed to understand the potential impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on waste management, and to identify what changes may be needed in waste management operations, planning, and policy. This research project, implemented in collaboration with the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, based in Kathmandu, Nepal, will undertake such research to increase climate resilience in three cities in South Asia: Bharatpur and Kawasoti in Nepal and Sylhet in Bangladesh. The project will inform management and policy decisions in the cities with improved evidence on and capacity to examine several key factors, including the solid waste drivers of water-logged drains and how these are likely to change with climate changes, efficacy and viability of different waste reduction approaches, including financial and infrastructure implications, and the use of GIS (global information systems) and drainage modeling for the future climate-smart planning of the city. The project will also study and pilot sustainable schemes for segregation and conversion of wastes into organic fertilizer/energy products for poor local communities using a cost-benefit analysis.Beyond the three cities, the research will reach out to a broader group of stakeholders to influence how cities think about and plan for waste management in the context of climate change.

It will assist the implementation of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) by addressing the most pressing requirements for support in 152 agrarian reform communities (ARCs) and ARC Clusters in 19 provinces in southern Philippines.  The long-term impact of the Project is to enable ARB households and other sections of the rural poor in approximately 152 selected ARCs and ARC Clusters (ARC Clusters will include target ARCs and ARBs and other farmers in adjacent areas) in 19 provinces (the provinces to be covered include Romblon, Marinduque, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Negros Oriental, Leyte, Eastern Samar, Northern Samar, Western Samar, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Shariff Kabunsuan, Maguindanao, Lanao Del Sur, Tawi Tawi, Basilan, and Sulu) to reduce their poverty, and have sustained improvements in their incomes and quality of life. In order to achieve these impacts, the Project is expected to bring about long lasting improvements in the capabilities and well being of poor and marginalized groups in the target communities. In order to achieve the above outcomes of poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, the Project will support the following outputs: (i) strong participation of local communities in the development process by the (a) enhancement of social capital among target communities through the use of a CDD approach, (b) detailed participatory ARC planning based on participation by the rural poor, as well as (c) improved capacity of ARC organizations and LGUs, for better governance and convergence in the provision of support services to target communities, (ii) agri enterprise development (AED)including (a) transfer of technology, (b) greater entrepreneurship among ARC organizations, (c) linkages between the private sector and corporate entities and ARC organizations, for increased investments into rural areas for growth, (d) wider prevalence of community based savings and lending groups for setting up sustainable micro-finance services among communities, (e)  Land Tenure Improvement to improve security of land titles, enable investments into productivity enhancements, (iii) improved access to rural infrastructure, designed to provide a boost to improved production and productivity, and crop intensification, and (iv) improved project management.",Disaster Risk Reduction,Yes,0.157518729567528
2020006845,Urgent Appeals: Data and Shared Learning,URGENT APPEALS: DATA AND SHARED LEARNING,"Context: The working conditions for today's typical garment worker are poor. The majority of production is located in the global south, mainly in parts of Asia, and ODA countries feature prominently as locations for production.  With low associational power and limited access to remedy, workers need international allies in order to get their voices heard. The Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) has campaigned for the accountability of brands and lobbied policy makers for some 30 years. One of its core mechanisms for interacting with human rights defenders (HRDs) and other civil society actors is its Urgent Appeal (UA) system.  Through the UA system workers and their organisations can contact CCC for support. Examples of UAs taken up by CCC include large scale disasters such as the Tazreen fire in Bangladesh in 2012, which killed over 100 workers, the Ali Enterprises Fire in Pakistan in 2012 where 265 people died, and the Rana Plaza building collapse in 2013 which killed over 1,000 workers and injured 2,000 more. In addition to health and safety, UAs may also relate to workers' rights such as freedom of association, wage theft or in relation to intimidation and harassment of HRDs. Each UA case file is a repository of information which, if organised, coded, analysed and fully utilised, could provide support for advocacy and campaigning at both international and local level.  In 2018 researchers at Cardiff University were awarded funding under the IAA NGO data fund, with the aim of constructing a user-friendly dataset of UA data that could be used by CCC in strategising campaigns, identifying tactics that have worked in specific contexts and providing a strong evidential base for targeted lobbying and advocacy. The project concluded in March 2019 with its limited objectives met, but having highlighted the need for further work to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data across cases and undertake more detailed analysis of relationships between variables in UA case histories.   Aims and objectives: The overarching aim of the proposed project is to maximise the use of UA data that CCC holds but has not hitherto fully utilised. Such data has significant potential as an evidential base for decision making, strategic planning and targeting of tactics in campaigning and advocacy. Two key objectives sit at the centre of the current application:   Research Objective 1: To further review and evaluate the UA IAA database in collaboration with CCC colleagues, with three aims:  a) to address issues highlighted to CCC in March 2019 around incomplete or inaccurate data, thereby improving its comprehensiveness and accuracy,  b) to undertake a comprehensive needs analysis and assess the functional capacity of the UA database for future usage in the light of sectoral trends,  c) to make recommendations for the maintenance and utilisation of the dataset within CCC.

WLP's mission is to transform power relations and promote justice, equality, peace, and sustainable development by strengthening the feminist movement. This is done through curriculum and resource development, training, capacity development, advocacy and movement building while promoting and sustaining leadership that is participatory and replicable. WLP's overall objective is to empower women to become active citizens and effective participatory leaders and to build communities of shared values of social and political change to achieve legal equality, economic justice, security and political participation through advocacy and movement building. Sida has funded WLP with core support from 2015. Through curriculum development, training, civil society strengthening, women's human rights advocacy and movement building, WLP has expanded partners' international, regional, and local leadership, raised public awareness on democracy and women's rights, strengthened democratic development and political participation by training more than 22,000 emerging leaders, and achieved commendable results through partners' advocacy and activism. WLP submitted an application to Sida for core support of 36 000 000 SEK for a four-year time-frame (2018-2022) on 27 March, 2018. The intervention will focus on capacity development of its partners, women and girls through training programs, produce and promote feminist research from the Global South, participate in and support women's organisations' advocacy and networking activities, preserve women's movement history though documentation of the women's movement, and expand WLP's international outreach for long-term sustainability. Additionally, WLP will expand its program in four new directions in response to external factors shaping the rights of women globally: i) empowering refugee women, ii) reforming family law, iii) promoting human security, and iv) strengthening the capacity of women's civil society organisations.The intervention's total budget for 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2022 is approximately 90 000 000 SEK, out of which WLP has secured funding of approximately 5 870 000 SEK (663 000 USD). Several of WLP's donors provide short term support which is expected to be renewed on a yearly basis. The support from Sida accounts for approximately 40% of the organization's total budget during the 4 year intervention period.","Women's rights organisations and movements, and government institutions",Review,0.133117586374283

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.  Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.  The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.

2020006748,GCRF Urban Violence & Climate Change Network,GCRF URBAN VIOLENCE & CLIMATE CHANGE NETWORK,"Violence and climate change risks in the global South are increasingly urbanised, convergent and growing development challenges, negatively affecting the livelihoods, mobility and well-being of the most marginalised urban communities. Both urban violence and climate change impacts in cities also have economic costs, which affect overall development outcomes. Non-conflict violence in particular - spanning several forms of violence including gang violence, sectarian conflict, landlord-tenant conflicts and gender-based / intersectional violence - accounts for the largest share of the global burden of armed violence and is in large part urban. However, its implications have not been fully understood in the context of the climate change impacts and responses affecting urban areas. Urbanisation in developing countries is driving up climate-related risks and vulnerabilities across a spectrum of hazards, while climate adaptation and mitigation responses are now taking place in ways that alter urban socio-ecological systems. Without explicit consideration of violence-related risks, climate change programmes may exacerbate urban violence, or simply not reach vulnerable areas. Conversely, greater synergy of response in urban planning practices to address public security and climate change vulnerability - through the design of public spaces or public health interventions - can support human development gains. All the countries included in the network face the development challenge of ensuring safe, sustainable and inclusive urban development occurs now and into the future, and without which they will not be able to achieve their Sustainable Development Goals.   Researchers and practitioners working on urban climate change and those working on urban violence have had little opportunity to connect agendas. As a result, we lack understanding of how the two phenomena relate in peoples' livelihoods and influence respective initiatives for risk reduction. The aim of the network is to address this gap through research and practice change, in order to reduce the vulnerabilities of marginalised urban groups. Working across cities in Brazil, Honduras, Kenya, Jordan, Sudan, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka, the network will support inter-disciplinary workshops with researchers, local and international civil society organisations, municipal governments and networks and international agencies. These will define a future research agenda. The network will also support related practitioner learning through stronger exchange about initiatives to address climate risks and peace building in urban contexts. This will involve webinars, the development of website resources and a practitioner exchange forum. Finally, the network will support participation of network members in major global policy debates about urban security, climate change and development, to raise the policy profile of the importance of considering urban violence-climate linkages, and the practical and ethical imp",Education policy and administrative management,Review,0.111843548715115

In their host nations, these displaced communities seek to reconstruct their lives in a context of loss, poverty, violence and devastation (Kuttab, 2008, Chatty, 2010). Here, as in other contexts of displacement and refugee movements, women and children are subject to the worst effects of such upheaval given their limited power and resources to counteract the ensuing violence and poverty (Al-Dajani and Marlow, 2013, Holmes, 2007, UN, 2006). The research aims of the project are to critically analyse the extent to which micro-entrepreneurship is a sustainable conduit for poverty alleviation and empowerment in socio-politically volatile circumstances, and to explore the effectiveness and impact of the available pathways for support and advice for displaced and refugee Iraqi, Palestinian and Syrian women displaced to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.  The project is will have impact in three categories, institutional, in terms of influence upon policy and practice in respect of poverty alleviation in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, capacity-building, in terms of empowering Arab refugee women to participate in enterprise activities, and conceptual in terms of influencing the debate around development assistance in these countries, and beyond. The most important primary beneficiaries of the project are the desperately poor Iraqi, Palestinian and Syrian refugee women and their families displaced to Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Through an enhanced understanding of their entrepreneuring to alleviate their poverty, and the opportunities and challenges that this presents, we will gain a deeper, richer and more relevant understanding of how national and international agencies can more effectively support these vulnerable communities. Thus, the national and international agencies that support the Arab refugee women in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey (referred to within this application as stakeholders) and their donors are also very important beneficiaries of the project.",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.0912690833210945

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.  Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.  The project is expected to directly affect 24,000 children (12,240 girls and 11,760 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 80 school facilities (60 formal public schools and 20 daraas or Koranic schools), as well as to indirectly affect 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.

It is important to underline how the activities envisaged in this intervention are part of an overall multi-year project: completed in 2019 the computerization of the first four stations - Ministry, Warehouse, Pharmacy of the Central Hospital and Laboratory - the project aims now at the creation of a hardware and software infrastructure for the optimization of the distribution of drugs in all pharmacies in the Sahrawi camps located in Algerian territory. Secondly, it intends to train local operators in the use and maintenance of technological tools such as PCs, servers, data transmission networks and application programs for the management of drug distribution. This will be achieved through the development of local skills in the planning and management of health services and through the preparation of adequate it and network equipment. The project also intends to promote human development and the training of local operators to be carried out through active learning models, based on good experience practices, with the supervision of professionals in the sector. Given the impossibility of accessing the camps due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the project has however recently been remodeled to cope with the health emergency and most of the planned activities are postponed to another period. The remodeling will make it possible to guarantee ADSL coverage also in 2021 and to equip the fields essentially with sanitary material to cope with the pandemic.",Health policy and administrative management,Review,0.0868536680936813

The Government of Bangladesh with the assistance of ADB implemented the First Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-I) from March 1998 to June 2005.  The Second Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP-II), supported by ADB and the Governments of the United Kingdom and Sweden, commenced in July 2005 and was completed in December 2012.  A provision of $50 million has been made for the Bangladesh Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project (UPHCSDP) in ADB's lending pipeline for 2012 in addition to $400,000 grant support for Supporting the Urban Primary Health Care Services Delivery Project in 2012. The UPHCSDP and the grant continue the provision of urban PHC, among others, through successful PPPs pioneered by UPHCP-I and II.  With a density of 2,756 people per square kilometer (km2) in urban areas and 843 people per km2 overall, Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world (excluding a few city-states).  Bangladesh is urbanizing at a rapid pace and the country's urban population is expected to reach 89.5 million (from 39.5 million in 2005) by 2030.  According to one estimate, by 2020 the urban poor figure could be as high as 40%-60% of the urban population.  Notwithstanding higher economic growth in urban areas, the absolute number of poor households is increasing in urban Bangladesh due to migration of rural poor into urban areas. Studies have shown that the health indicators of the urban poor are as worse as those of the rural poor because of poorer living conditions, and limited urban PHC. Failure to provide urban PHC can have serious negative externalities - spread of communicable diseases, debilitating epidemics, reduction in economic productivity, among others.",Health policy and administrative management,Review,0.0835825651884079

Se benefician 190 personas.Todas las mujeres han llegado a El Líbano huyendo de la guerra, después de perder a sus maridos y otros familiares cercanos. Viven con la condición de refugiadas, que otorga el ACNUR1-Esta condición les permite estar en el país pero no les dan opción a trabajar, por lo que las condiciones de vida son muy duras. Todas dependen de la Ayuda Humanitaria. Los hombres refugiados consiguen trabajo más fácilmente en las labores del campo, pero la condición de la mujer es todavía más complicada. A esto se unen los abusos sistemáticos que sufren las mujeres solas refugiadas en El Líbano (ver informe que adjuntamos de amnistía internacional), tanto a nivel social como laboral.Actualmente viven en una casa cedida por un ciudadano libanes en las afueras de la ciudad. Cada una de las mujeres con sus hijos ocupa una habitación de la casa, y comparten la cocina y el baño.Proponemos la creación de esta cooperativa, que les permitirá obtener algunos ingresos, los mínimos para poder cubrir sus necesidades básicas. El jabón de Alepo queremos comercializarlo también en España, todos los beneficios serán para las mujeres.","Women's rights organisations and movements, and government institutions",Review,0.0754980817437172

Project: 12091 Improving employment and livelihood opportunities for Somali and   youth through TVET and business skills development    2. Project area and Country: Hargeisa, Somaliland3. Project justification: Somaliland is one of the poorest nations in the world. About 60% of Somalilanders are youth aged 15-35 years old, among those 40% are aged 15-29. The overall adult literacy rate across Somaliland is of 45.3% (50.2% among men and 40.2 among women). The unemployment rate in Somaliland among youth aged 14-29 is 67%, one of the highest rate in the world, with women experiencing higher unemployment rate at 74% than men at 61%. The majority of the employment is classified as vulnerable employment with low wages, low level of social security, poor working conditions, and limited worker rights, with women experiencing more vulnerability than men do. Poor to no level of education leaves the vast majority of youth with little opportunity to access the labour market, rendering them without hope and perspective. 4. The main objective and the expected results:The project aims to contribute to sustainable and profitable employment and self-employment opportunities for male and female youth from IDPs, host communities and returnees in Hargeisa of Somaliland. The aim is going to be achieved by following FCA's thematic pillars of right to livelihood (R2L) and right to quality education (R2QE).

Despite shocks from the 2015 earthquakes and 2015?2016 trade disruptions, the economy rebounded to grow at an average annual rate of 7.3% during FY2017? FY2019. The government aims for Nepal to graduate from least-developed country status by 2022 and reach middle-income status by 2030.  The recent move to a federal governance system mandated by the 2015 constitution offers opportunities to deliver better services for poverty reduction and enhanced economic growth. The key challenge for Nepal is using this window of opportunity to lay a stronger foundation for sustained increase in economic growth and provide jobs for its young and growing labor force to realize the country?s aspirations. Addressing these challenges requires diversifying Nepal?s economic base away from a heavy reliance on agriculture, remittances, and informal services towards higher-value industry and formal sectors, reducing the high unemployment rate (11.4%)  and preparing the current as well as future workforce to be productive and competitive in the global market. Building a diversified and agile workforce with strong foundational and higher-order skills while simultaneously upgrading technical and specialized skills among new entrants and existing workers in the labor force will be critical to the country?s development goals. Thus, under the 15th development plan for FY2020?FY2024, the government has prioritized investing in human capital along with raising productivity in agriculture and industry sectors, and effective implementation of the federal governance system to achieve high and inclusive economic growth.",Education policy and administrative management,Review,0.0586732588708401

2018181483,F.a: Building strong and resilient local trade unions in the Malawi tea supply chain,F.A: BUILDING STRONG AND RESILIENT LOCAL TRADE UNIONS IN THE MALAWI TEA SUPPLY CHAIN,"Malawi is Africa's second largest tea producer, after Kenya. The tea industry is the largest formal sector employer in Malawi, employing more than 50,000 workers. The purchasing power of the CBA remains far from a living wage. Negotiation between the workers and the national tea producers' association has proved a challenge for the workers, as the trade union is struggling to maintain the 15 % minimum threshold required to grant them bargaining rights. One reason for low union membership is short term contracts. In many tea estates joint consultative committees are preferred over trade union membership as they don't have a membership fee. This has translated into inactive plantation level trade unions and shop stewards. Workers low productivity don't support trade union's demands for wage increase. Significant number of women work in the tea sector, and they face several gender-based challenges like GBV, low job security in case of pregnancy and weak opportunities for managerial positions. The issue of harsh treatment and harassment by capitaos and the difficulties involved in raising these issues is an important driver of vulnerability, especially for unskilled women labourers. The US Department of Labor recognizes the use of forced labour and/or child labour in the tea industry in Malawi. Elderly people, people with disabilities and people with HIV/AIDS have an even higher vulnerability to low wages, as they tend to be the first to lose their jobs during economic hardships. Malawi is also really vulnerable for climate change and has experienced series of heavy rains, landslides and flooding.The rightsholders of the project are 6,400 workers in 2 tea plantations in Malawi, of which 23 per cent are women. The goal of the project is to ensure right to a sustainable livelihood for worker households in tea sector in Malawi. The purpose of the project is improved terms, conditions and rights at work. The expected outputs of the project are: 1) Strengthened trade union capacity to represent workers, 2) improved worker welfare in tea estates, 3) Improved worker productivity, 4) Improved resilience and adaptation to climate change and environmental degradation by tea estates, 5) Improved gender equality, 6) Increased work opportunities for people with disabilities in tea estates.The project is implemented by Fairtrade Africa in cooperation with the trade union PAWU, Tea Association of Malawi (TAML) and Oxfam. http://www.fairtradeafrica.net/",Employment creation,Review,0.0575331710278988

The project also works to promote women's leadership and decision-making in the agriculture sector. Climate change and climate-induced natural disasters present a major risk to crop production in the Caribbean, where agriculture is an important source of employment for rural communities. The project targets five low to middle-income Caribbean countries, Dominica, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Lucia, and Suriname, with the greatest potential for climate smart economic growth. Project activities include: (1) engaging multiple stakeholders, including established country partners, to create links between key market actors, (2) providing training, information sharing, and outreach to women and youth to strengthen their capacity, (3) coordinating gender sensitive social outreach and engagement campaigns targeting market actors, to address barriers and enhance access to inclusive, sustainable and climate resilient agricultural market systems, and (4) fostering climate resilient approaches (re-orienting agricultural development for sustainability), at every stage and via every market actor in the agricultural value chain.  The project expects to benefit up to 48,000 people, including 12,000 farmers (of which 75% are women or youth) and their families. The project also aims to reach 340,000 people through the project's communications efforts. / Ce projet vise à accroître la prospérité économique des femmes et des jeunes sur des marchés agricoles plus durables.

Accurate diagnostic techniques are the cornerstone of both infectious and non-infectious disease detection, clinical case management and control. However, diagnostic capacity is often discussed during disease outbreaks and then neglected once the immediate communicable threats are over. Disadvantaged populations often lack access to well-equipped laboratory infrastructure, sample transportation and rapid results, hindering efforts to control disease impact, spread, and resulting in a major source of health inequity. Here we propose a 2-years collaboration of the division of KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Nanobiotechnology division,the Mbarara University of Science and Technology, the Mbarara Regional Referral University Hospital and Doctors Without Border's Epicentre to build a sustainable know-how platform for diagnostic capacity building. In Sweden, we are currently leading technological advancement for life sciences with focus on resource-limited settings. Uganda has expertise in managing outbreaks, but when it comes to local diagnostic capacity, still lags behind.

FOCUSING A GENDERED LENS ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE, CREDIT, AND NUTRITION IN TRANSLOCAL CAMBODIA AND SOUTH INDIA","Small-scale credit is exalted in mainstream development thinking as a key means of supporting women and their families in dealing with daily, ongoing, and often slow-onset climate disasters. Facing growing crises of agricultural productivity from droughts and floods, and taking primary responsibility for the nutritional wellbeing of their households, women are targeted as credit borrowers globally. Credit provisioning therefore speaks to the push for 'resilience' against climate disasters that is central to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13, 'Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts', and which has serious implications for SDG 5 'Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls' that prioritises the valuing and recognition of women's unpaid care and domestic work. How do we ensure, then, that 'climate resilience' does not come at the cost of women's emotional and bodily depletion through processes of household nutrition provisioning? This is the key concern motivating this two-year project which asks:  (1) In what ways is credit, as a form of climate resilience, shaping nutritional provisioning?  (2) How are the dynamics of nutrition provisioning and credit-taking in a changing climate being experienced and visualised?  (3) What are the gender and social reproductive dynamics of the climate-credit-nutrition nexus?  (4) What lessons can be learned to deliver improved and more equitable credit provisioning and nutritional outcomes to households and communities affected by slow-onset climate disasters?  The project's methodology is anchored in environmental science, visual arts, and social science methods which are combined into a well-integrated research design to effectively probe these complex questions. Set within the political economy contexts of Cambodia and Tamil Nadu, India, fieldwork encompasses the collection of environmental profiles, socio-economic and nutritional indicators, measurements of energy expenditure, and oral and visual analysis, all through a lens that foregrounds gender dynamics. In each country, research will be carried out in 3 rural villages and 2 industrial worksites given that rural households are often maintained by labour migrants engaged in non-rural work.   The 20-strong interdisciplinary team of investigators, consultants, and a seconded UN Women staff member, from Cambodia, India, the UK, and continental Europe, will work together with non-governmental and private sector project partners, and an advisory board of (non)academic experts, to deliver this ground-breaking research. The project will also foster the research excellence and development of 7 early career researchers, the majority of whom are women, and/or black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Mentorship includes two early-career residential writing retreats, one in Cambodia and one in India, to support the development of publication writing skills and confidence.

2019061158A,UNDP Strategic Collaboration Framework on Environment and Climate Change - UNDP Environment and Climate Framework,UNDP STRATEGIC COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK ON ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE - UNDP ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE FRAMEWORK,"UNDP has applied to Sida for funding of SEK 380 000 000 to carry out the UNDP-Sida Strategic Collaboration Framework on Environment and Climate Change, a programme that will be implemented at the global, regional and country level during the period 2019-2023. It primarily aims at supporting the overall vision of UNDP's Strategic Plan 2018-2021: to help countries achieve sustainable development by eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, accelerate structural transformations for sustainable development and build resilience to crises and shocks. This will be made possible by providing support for the programmes's two building blocks: 1) About 80 % in support of specific UNDP-implemented projects and initiatives in three selected program areas, aimed at strengthening both thematic work, as well as integration and synergies between the areas: (a) Sustainable management and use of ecosystems, biodiversity and natural capital, (b) Sustainable water and ocean governance and (c) Improved climate measures for sustainable development, as well as the nexus area of sustainable food systems where all programme areas are included, and2) About 20 % of the support towards strengthening the organisational capacity and performance of UNDP to facilitate the transition to more strategic, integrated and programmatic practices that tie together all the projects in the area of environment and climate change and a stronger learning that put together are expected to lead to improved and more transformative results at the country level. The aim is to contribute to a programmatic approach making the whole larger than the sum of all UNDP-implemented environment and climate change projects and decrease fragmentation.The contribution implies that all global support from Sida to UNDP in the area of environment and climate change will be collected under one umbrella programme, including the two on-going contributions within water and oceans (Water and Ocean Governance och Ocean Innovation Challenge). All the programme areas are relevant to the strategy for Sweden's global development cooperation on sustainable environment, sustainable climate and ocean, and sustainable use of natural resources 2018-2022. In addition, the programme is fully in line with the government's strategy for cooperation with UNDP 2017 - 2021 and above all that UNDP should develop its activities in climate change, ecosystems, resilience and environmentally sustainable communities.Between 5-10 pilot countries will be selected jointly by Sida and UNDP, focusing on the poorest countries, to carry out the activities under the Programme's two building blocks. UNDP has proposed a preliminary list of 11 countries based on a number of agreed criteria. Thes include, country demand for the support, that UNDP has a large project portfolio in the country -  NDC support including support from vertical funds, a strong focus on LDC's and Sida's partner countries and that at least one small island developing",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.0475002713501453

Growth that works for everyone is fostered by working towards equal participation of women in the Lebanese economy, specifically through skills training and support, technical assistance to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) to develop their business and create employment opportunities and by supporting businesses in providing services assisting women's participation in the workforce. This project links youth and women to market-driven skills training, in partnership with the private sector to connect youth with employment opportunities. The project also helps entrepreneurs by providing technical assistance or in-kind support packages to accelerate growth and foster merit-based hiring practices. Training and/or business coaching is also provided to potential start-ups to help create employment. The project supports businesses in developing gender-inclusive practices to increase the hiring and retention of women. Additionally, an analysis of the barriers impeding women and girls from accessing skills and job opportunities is also conducted.

Also, the ongoing Second Small-Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project (SSW 2), which commenced in 2002 and is due to be completed in 2009. This has developed 275 subprojectsin 61 of 64 districts of Bangladesh. The Project will support the development of inclusive water management cooperative associations (WMCAS) that include landowners, land operators, women, fishers, and other vulnerable groups. The WMCAS should have sufficient social and technical capital to undertake small-scale water resources (SSWR) subprojects and to improve system operations. They should have clear financing partnerships and/or cost-sharing mechanisms so they can carry out sustainable maintenance. Within an enabling institutional framework, they should be capable of maximizing their collective potential to increase agriculture production in the subproject areas. The Project will have three outputs: (i) institutional strengthening of government agencies at all levels to support SSWR development, (ii) participatory subprojects, which will include poor and vulnerable groups, and which will enable WMCAs to plan, implement, operate, and maintain subprojects, and (iii) construction and maintenance of up to 270 SSWR subprojects and performance enhancement of up to 150 subprojects (out of 560 completed) from SSW 1 and 2 projects.",Disaster Risk Reduction,Yes,0.0388343334197998

It aims to strengthen international efforts to increase compliance with the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). To be compliant with the IHR, countries must build, strengthen and maintain the capacity to detect, assess, report and respond to potential Public Health Emergencies of International Concern, as well as providing facilities, services, inspections and control activities at designated international airports, ports and ground crossings to prevent the international spread of disease. Lack of capacity to meet the requirements of the IHR puts countries at greater risk from the threat of outbreaks of infectious diseases and other health emergencies, and has implications on a global scale if the countries are unable to appropriately detect, report and respond to Public Health Emergencies of International Concern. The IHR Strengthening Project works directly in partnership with six ODA-eligible countries, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Pakistan, Myanmar and Zambia, engaging with their ministries of health and national public health institutions to support the building of technical capacity and the strengthening of organisations, systems, workforces and leadership. This approach aims to foster ownership and deliver more sustainable benefits than if the countries were to rely on alternative short-term technical support. Through its work in the partner countries, alongside engagement with regional agencies such as Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network, as well as the WHO and its regional offices, the project also seeks to have a broader regional and international influence in driving IHR compliance and improving system coordination for global health security.",Health policy and administrative management,Review,0.0385940819978714

The project focuses on building the capacity of child protection and education actors, creating a safe school environment and raising students' and communities' awareness of children's rights. With a view to ensure appropriate support of child protection systems in school environments, the project simultaneously works on systems, services and programs, early intervention services and prevention.  Project activities include: (1) training security forces, magistrates, social workers and school authorities on legal instruments relating to child protection, (2) developing a national action plan to counter child abuse in school environments, raising school stakeholders' awareness of preventive control measures for epidemics (e.g., Ebola hemorrhagic fever), (3) involving a number of stakeholders in awareness campaigns to discontinue early and forced marriage practices, and (4) raising economic operators' awareness of alternative solutions to child labour in mining areas.  The project is expected to directly affect 750,000 children (382,500 girls and 367,500 boys), ranging in age from 3 to 18 years and registered in 1,700 public school facilities, as well as to affect indirectly 10,000 youth who are out of school or who have no schooling (6,500 girls and 3,500 boys) from 14 to 18 years of age.

This project implemented by Developmental Action without Borders (Naba?a) intends to contribute to the  reduction of early marriage in the most vulnerable and neglected communities (Lebanese and Syrian) in Akkar North Lebanon and providing a protective environment particularly for young and adolescent girls. The project is based on the recommendations of the previous project funded by the Finnish Embassy. This will be achieved through four main project components: 1) The first component aims to reshape the lives of the most marginalized Lebanese young and adolescent girls through enrolling them in a vocational training center to study a vocational profession. This might help them to find better job opportunities and prevent their early marriage as they are able to cover their daily expenses.  2) The second component is working on empowering and enhancing the skills of the girls to be girls advocacy activists within their communities at the local and national levels. 3)The third component will be focused on the parents adolescent girls and Community Members whom will be empowered and Enabled to take Informed Decisions and to become Agents of Positive Change in order to prevent and Respond to Early Marriage. This will be achieved through awareness raising capacity development for parents particularly mothers and community leaders on the child rights protection and the risks of early marriage. 4)The fourth component will be focused on the advocacy and lobbying where the community Leaders and influential persons including religious leaders are aware about the risks of child marriage and agree that marriage should not be contracted before 18 years in any circumstances.

They also provide other benefits such as fisheries and tourism. However, extreme storm surges can damage these ecosystems. This reduces their capacity to protect coastal communities from storms that can cause deaths and damage property, and their ability to play a multi-functional role in human well-being, e.g. providing food through fisheries or controlling erosion. It is important to manage these ecosystems well and assist their recovery when they are damaged, so that coastal communities can recover quickly from extreme events. Financial investment in active restoration of these ecosystems is feasible and can be cost-effective over small areas. When large areas of habitat are damaged, setting aside areas of the ecosystem as reserves may be a more cost-effective approach, but people who depend on the ecosystem for their livelihoods, such as fishermen, need to be compensated financially for loss of short-term earnings.   Insurance of these ecosystems could provide a solution to allow for immediate funds to be made available, whether for restoration or as compensation to fishermen. The availability of such an insurance product would enable rehabilitation of the reef or seagrass bed following an extreme storm surge to recover their protective and livelihood-related functions. There has been relatively little work on the development of insurance products to protect public assets such as ecosystems and their services, and this has left a large protection gap. The CERFF project therefore represents an important and timely innovation in the design and development of disaster risk financing instruments.  Developing an effective ecosystem-based insurance product requires a quantified understanding of the extent to which coastal ecosystems reduce risk and damages from storm surges in different situations, and how this varies with potentially confounding factors. These include: (i) the geographical distribution of key habitats, (ii) their functional capacity, (iii) the damage they can suffer, (iv) an assessment of their condition as a baseline, (v) an understanding of how this baseline may change over time in relation to other stressors such as ocean acidification, pollution or overfishing, and (vi) an understanding of the time period and uncertainties around restoration or regeneration.   The CERFF project brings together applied scientists and academics from natural and social sciences and the humanities, with a leading global broking and solutions company. The CERFF team will develop an insurance product to build disaster mitigation capacity through a market-based mechanism that can facilitate rapid responses in relation to extreme events and also incentivise preparedness behaviour. It builds on extensive marine data that Cefas has recently acquired through the Commonwealth Marine Economies programme.

2020006709,GCRF: One Health Regional Network for the Horn of Africa (HORN),GCRF: ONE HEALTH REGIONAL NETWORK FOR THE HORN OF AFRICA (HORN),"One Health is the concept that the health and well-being of people is linked to the health of their animals and the environment.  It is nowhere more true than in the Horn of Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia) where many people's livelihoods are highly, or in some cases entirely, dependent on livestock. Animals are culturally, socially and economically vital in the region. Livestock provide, for example, over 60% of agricultural GDP in the Horn. Livestock are also a source of human disease. Outbreaks of disease in animals thereby directly affect people's health but also their wealth and nutrition.  Livestock production and human health and wellbeing in the Horn of Africa can be increased through research, leading to improved agricultural systems, more food and less malnutrition, more financial resilience, and better detection, diagnosis, prevention and control of disease.  HORN's mission is to improve the health and wealth of the people of the Horn of Africa by increasing the local capacity to undertake high quality research in the interactions between people and animals - One Health.  HORN aims to develop a One Health Regional Network - a network of individuals and organisations across the Horn of Africa that can undertake high quality research into the link between people's health and wealth and that of livestock and the environment.  HORN will strengthen the ability of organisations to undertake research with a 5 step process.  (i) First, the current research capacity of the organisations will be assessed, relative to their goals, a plan will then be developed to bridge the gap, implemented, and progress will be monitored. (ii) Following from #1, training will be provided to non-academics in these organisations that have roles that provide the foundations for research: these could be leadership roles, technical roles or other roles, such as in finance or contracts or IT. (iii) Training will also be provided to academic researchers from the region. Workshops and short courses (2-5 days), 4-8 week masterclasses and summer schools will educate researchers  in aspects of One Health, as well as providing the generic skills that underpin high quality research, like research methods, statistics, presentation, grantsmanship.  An e-learning platform will enable a wider body of researchers to access the course material. (iv) Researchers will 'learn on the job' by undertaking research projects of 3-12 months duration. These projects will be co-created (by discussion and interaction with expert academics) at group events ('sandpits'), with successful ideas rapidly agreed and funded. Mobility of many researchers between countries is envisaged, with research focused in specific parts of Kenya and Ethiopia. UK researchers will be based in these countries too, following research programmes aligned with the development challenges, and providing supervision and mentoring to the researchers from the Horn countries.

This project seeks to understand the complexity of youth dissatisfaction and negative coping mechanisms, including radicalization and emigration, in Lebanon (including Syrian refugees) and Tunisia. Despite increasing youth dissatisfaction with the failure of Arab states to address the above issues, this project recognizes untapped youth potential and seeks to promote youth as agents of change, rather than objects awaiting resources and intervention. This project rests on two pillars. The first seeks to understand the challenges, problems, aspirations, inspirations, and perspectives of youth (including women) and then encourages them to engage with positive inspirational figures or role models from their countries. This will be conducted through focus groups, experimental surveys, and role-model workshops. The second analyzes the existing institutional policies that have an impact on youth. A task force process will be launched to discuss, develop, and promote policies that meet youth needs with the relevant government officials and civil society organizations. Through interviews, focus groups, workshops, regional meetings, and publications, including a policy book and policy recommendations, the project will provide new knowledge on what inspires and motivates youth and how role models have an impact on them.

As the first point of arrival after flying across the Gulf of Mexico, when the birds arrive it is vitally important that they immediately find places that, provide protection and food to recuperate and refuel. However, the wetlands have been degraded and suffered extensive loss of cover, in some cases up to 75%. The degradation and loss of mangrove and wetlands have been due to construction of roads, opening of artificial ports that connect wetlands to the sea, and hurricanes, as well as construction of urban, agricultural and tourist infrastructure. With the interruption of surface flows and excessive evaporation, soils accumulate salt and reach salinity values that cannot be tolerated by mangroves. As a follow-up to actions during the previous phase of the project, 714 acres will be restored through channel dredging and flow recovery in Ría Celestún Biosphere Reserve, Ría Lagartos Biosphere Reserve, Ciénagas and Mangroves of the Yucatán North Coast State Reserve, and El Palmar State Reserve. Restoration will be carried out on 247 new acres in urgent need of restoration in Dzilam de Bravo State Reserve. The project will also reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities through risk analysis and modelling ecosystem services and adaptation measures, build local capacity and promote awareness of the importance of migratory birds, monitor birds and bird habitat use, and monitor the success of mangrove restoration actions.",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.0243532806634903

The goal is to help local leaders and community members (Lebanese residents and Syrian refugees) to develop respectful relationships with one another, and collaborate more effectively to promote social stability. The project is inspired by the concept of a Diwan (An Arabic word symbolizing an audience hall or  tent, where community members gather to socialize and resolve conflicts). This project targets women and youth, who have traditionally been left out of local decision-making processes, as well as various local leaders and governance actors. Project activities include: (1) providing training workshops, (2) organizing community roundtable discussions, (3) planning community projects, (4) supporting youth community centers, and (5) encouraging cross-municipality collaboration. This project involves 480 direct beneficiaries and 5,000 indirect beneficiaries. / Ce projet vise à contribuer à une gouvernance plus inclusive et participative dans les municipalités de la région de Wadi Khaled, dans le nord du Liban.

Le projet s'inspire du concept du « diwan » (mot arabe désignant une salle ou un lieu où les membres de la communauté socialisent et règlent des conflits). Ce projet vise les femmes et les jeunes, qui ont été traditionnellement ignorés dans les processus décisionnels, ainsi que divers dirigeants locaux et intervenants de la gouvernance. Parmi les activités du projet : 1) offrir des ateliers de formation, 2) organiser des tables rondes communautaires, 3) planifier des projets communautaires, 4) soutenir des centres communautaires pour jeunes, 5) encourager la collaboration entre les municipalités.

If developing countries are able to conduct high-quality research, they will be able to develop evidence-informed policy and practice, improve human capital and produce pro-poor products/technologies, all of which will accelerate social and economic development. Stronger research skills, systems, infrastructure and governance (i.e. research capacity) in developing countries will also benefit the UK national interest since poverty, migration, and epidemics, while concentrated in developing countries, impact globally. The UK is a world leader in supporting developing countries to strengthen their capacity for research and innovation. In recent years international development donors and governments have strengthened their spending on research capacity strengthening which has now become a cornerstone of international development assistance. Nevertheless, Africa in particular, lags far behind in global research capacity - in 1999-2008 African nations produced 27,000 papers/year, about the same number as The Netherlands. The £1.5Bn GCRF supports collaborative, large-scale projects between UK and developing country institutions. Many of these projects directly or indirectly contribute to strengthening research capacity in their partner institutions in developing countries by, for example, introducing research skills courses, purchasing equipment and facilitating networks. However, much of this effort is wasted because these capacity improvements are not institutionalised or sustained in the long-term. This is because the institutionalisation of changes was not the main purpose of the project and sustainability can take decades to achieve.  In phase 1 we will identify strategies that have been used by GCRF and other UK-funded projects covering different research disciplines. We will collect data, initially through a survey, about what gains in research capacity were initiated by these projects and if, and how, these have been institutionalised, financed and sustained.  Through our cluster members we will access information from around 100 of these projects' partner institutions in at least 20 African countries, including many of the poorest countries. This will provide information about what changes in research capacity have been initiated. To find out why and how these changes happened, why some succeeded and others did not, and to understand how the different contexts may influence uptake, financing and sustainability, we will undertake in-depth interviews with a range of key researchers, research managers, development funders and senior university officials in Africa and the UK. We will verify our findings by scrutinising the projects' annual reports and evaluations.

The area has been devoid of significant externally financed development intervention for the last two decades due to a 20-year insurgency, which resulted in a general deterioration in the quality of life of the CHT population. Basic socioeconomic indicators for the CHT reveal a region suffering from both low income and poverty, especially among the rural population. The Project has been designed to contribute to a reduction in the incidence of absolute poverty in the CHT and to provide a confidence-building environment to underpin the 1997 peace accord in which local communities will be empowered to decide on their own development priorities and actively participate in the subsequent investments. The Project will increase employment and income generating opportunities for the population, and result in a general improvement in the quality of life of the target population.",Disaster Risk Reduction,Yes,0.0168522354215384

It should be emphasized that the activities of this TC will allow the reduction of landslides and the protection of the areas of environmental importance around Guadalajara's metropolitan area. The expansion of the urban spot in this area has had severe consequences on its environment and requires better planning to strengthen this biological corridor, which represents an area of distribution for 1,000 species of flora and fauna (with species in threatened status, danger of extinction and special protection).",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.0167849082499743

The Sweden/Sida and OECD cooperation will focus on 1.Regulatory blockages: an area that have continuously been highlighted as preventing the flow of funds to developing countries. Sida and OECD are inspired by the recent report by the Global Investors for Sustainable Development called Renewed Recharged and Reinforced, urgent actions to harmonise and scale sustainable finance from July 2020 and OECD is planning to organize an event on the report and document possible policy measures for different actors and possible follow-up activities at the OECD February conference,   2.Secondly, Sweden/Sida will support OECD for a longer research activity around securitisation technics and implications relating to financial modelling.

While the focus will be on cooperation with development finance institutions we also hope to explore the possibilities and challenges to connect with private financial institutions,The latter is important as one of the main challenges in ensuring effective capital flows for the SDGs is the availability of projects and assets that are both bankable and aggregated in sufficiently large portfolios.

To achieve these objectives, the project intends to launch virtuous economic circles through the creation of synergies between agro-pastoral and commercial production sectors.

Increasing rates of urban inequality since the 1990s affect directly prosperity and resilience outcomes in urban areas. Increasing rates of urban inequality hold back economic, social and political progress and can contribute to conflicts and extreme poverty. In the age of urbanisation, with more than half of the World's population living in urban areas, achieving urban equality is a major global challenge. Three quarters of the World's urban areas are more unequal today than they were 20 years ago. Close to 1 billion people worldwide live in informal settlements, deprived of basic services and livelihood opportunities. The challenge of urban inequality has inspired a new global discourse on the future of cities and urban areas. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, the 'urban' goal, emphasise the need to deliver inclusive cities. The New Urban Agenda (NUA) adopted by national governments in Quito, October 2016, asks for urban policies for a city that leave 'no one behind'.  The project 'Knowledge in Action for Urban Equality' (henceforth KNOW) seeks to develop research capacities in developing countries and in UK institutions that deliver ODA research, to deliver on the SDG11 and the NUA. KNOW focuses on the major knowledge gap in global policy agendas: delivering urban equality for inclusive cities of opportunities for all. The work programme focuses on three key challenges: achieving prosperity, building resilience to disasters and a changing climate, and addressing the persistent problem of extreme poverty.  The work programme is divided in six work packages. Three work packages focus on learning-by-doing, that is, doing research as a means to build capacity. Work Package 1 will deliver city-relevant research in several countries including Perú, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Tanzania, Uganda, Sierra Leona, India, and Sri Lanka. In each case, KNOW will support the formation of a network of overseas and local academics, and stakeholders who will work together to identify the specific challenges associated with urban inequality that emerge in each city. Work Package 2 will use different case-based experiences to develop a comparative programme of research across cities, exploring the challenges of prosperity, resilience, and extreme poverty. Work Package 3 will focus on develop an 'Ethics of Practice' for urban research, within the framework of the Global Challenges Research Fund. Three work packages will focus on delivering capacities to maximise the impact of research.  Work Package 4 will focus on how to translate research into practice, working with key policy makers, intermediaries, and activists to explore the development of urban policy following the programme of research in each city.

Public protests over a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit caused by economic and financial mismanagement have led to demands for political accountability, early parliamentary elections, and social and economic reforms. In parallel, the country's financial situation has worsened significantly, with the contracting economy threatening local markets, businesses, and livelihoods.This project seeks to inform and shape policy debates on pressing political, social, economic, and financial issues in the context of the protest movements that have overwhelmed the country. The aim is to safeguard the interests and welfare of citizens seeking to negotiate a new social contract while assisting policymakers in the process of designing and implementing public policies and policy reforms.To this end, a gender-balanced working group comprised of experts, academics, and key thought leaders emerging from the protest movement will be established to guide the project. The working group will guide the design of seven roundtable discussions with multiple stakeholders to promote informed debate and discussion. These discussions will generate evidence-based outputs in the form of policy briefs, videos, and podcasts to be disseminated to policymakers and the general public. The aim is to develop policy options, assess their implications, and guide national decision-makers and future leaders of the country.

2020006777,Mathematical Modelling for Infectious Disease Dynamics and Control in East Africa (MMIDD-EA),MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE DYNAMICS AND CONTROL IN EAST AFRICA (MMIDD-EA),"Computer-based mathematical modelling of infectious diseases is an essential tool to understanding how diseases spread. They can also be extremely useful in designing effective control strategies and policies. The East Africa region is a hotspot for emerging and endemic diseases caused by bacteria and viruses, including those spread from animals to humans (known as zoonoses). Despite the potential for mathematical modelling to address public health challenges in the region and the availability of relatively cheap computing power and free programming platforms, these skills are rarely applied by academics and researchers in low and middle income countries. Instead modelling work is done by researchers from high income countries and often for diseases threatening global health such as epidemics caused by the Ebola virus. We aim to develop a network of East-African based mathematical modellers to build skills and capacity so that this work can be performed for priority infectious diseases in the region and by local researchers, who have a superior understanding of the social, economic, geographic and political context of infectious disease spread and control.  To do this we will organise three activities. First, we will develop and run an intensive short-course in mathematical modelling of infectious disease dynamics for 20 people in Kenya. Applications will be sought from researchers based in East Africa with skills in mathematics and an interest in quantitative approaches to infectious disease dynamics and control in humans and animals. A competitive selection procedure will prioritise candidates with both institutional support and defined modelling projects relevant to the region to carry forward. The course will be based upon the well-established and highly regarded Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease Dynamics residential course supported by the Wellcome Trust, led Dr Andrew Conlan (University of Cambridge) and modified to be appropriate to the needs identified in East Africa. The course will have a strong emphasis on building practical skills using the free software R and Rstudio, and focussed on infectious diseases that are important in the region.  Second, five fellowships will be awarded to course attendees to enable them to further develop their skills. Each fellow will be matched to a mentor from the University of Cambridge or the broader course faculty (drawn from across the UK and Africa) who will work with them to develop their skills and collaborate on a selected modelling projects. The fellows will have the opportunity to spend up to 3 months in Cambridge (or other UK Institute, as befits their project and development needs) as well as the opportunity to spend time at the University of Nairobi and interact with their cohort. Third, we will support the development of an East African infectious disease modelling network, by linking with other complementary initiatives in the region.

An oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is available and in use around the world, but it has lower efficacy in young children than in adults and a relatively short duration of protection necessitating re-vaccination every few years. We are developing a new conjugate vaccine that offers the promise of improved efficacy in all age groups, including those less than 5 years, and an extended duration of protection, thus reducing the requirements for repetitive vaccination to sustain population immunity. It can be implemented in place of OCV or as a complementary tool to prevent or limit outbreaks in high risk settings, and build enduring population immunity that will costeffectively control cholera over the decades required to build definitive public health capacities in at risk countries.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.00787132419645786

Risks are projected to increase significantly in future years due to climate change and the anticipation of possible losses discourages farmers from making productivity-enhancing investments, thereby trapping them in low-risk, low-return agriculture. Agricultural insurance, complemented with other risk-reducing practices, can be a sustainable approach to unlock investments in agriculture for smallholders that improve their resilience and productivity. Crop insurance protects farmers against financial risks posed by extreme weather events and has been widely advocated as a tool to help farmer households escape poverty traps and invest in climate-smart high-productivity agriculture. The number of successful insurance schemes targeting smallholders is limited due to high monitoring and verification costs of traditional insurance, low demand for index-based insurance (designed to eliminate the need to verify losses) mainly due to poor trust and basis risks (i.e. the imperfect correlation between farmers' actual losses and insurance payouts), and the fact that insurance products often neglect complementary risk-management options such as irrigation and drought-tolerant cultivars. This project aims to overcome these problems through climate-smart picture-based insurance, which uses satellite and cellphone imagery to verify losses, observe management practices, and promote the adoption of productivity-enhancing and resilient technologies through advisories and bundling. Ground pictures taken by farmers will help reduce monitoring costs, minimize basis risks, and create synergies with climate-smart resilience technologies. By taking pictures of insured crops, farmers engage directly in the insurance process and improve trust and tangibility. The project will compare the picture and satellite-based insurance with the current area and yield-based insurance and it will assess the effectiveness of increasing the productivity, resilience, and food security of women, men, and youth smallholder farmers in Kenya.

ARCHAEOLOGY AND HERITAGE IN THE NORTH WEST.,"We aim to create a research network between the UK and Sri Lanka to bring together archaeology and heritage academics and professionals, new researchers and graduate students, and representatives of NGOs, CSOs, and community groups, to develop dialogues that address challenges in the relevance and application of archaeology and heritage. This network will be a platform for building a new research project, allowing cross-disciplinary opportunities to co-create research that is relevant both to academics and to wider communities in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan heritage is currently heavily oriented towards World Heritage sites of the early historic period, and a major challenge for the network is to explore ways to diversify this agenda. Of special interest to the network are heritages of the everyday and the more recent past, and finding approaches that value and privilege these in addition to the authorised heritage is a significant challenge. We believe there is space to offer different and multiple understandings of heritage in Sri Lanka, and want to use the research network to think through the value of working in the later historical period (i.e. 1200-1948) and exploring, recording and presenting heritages of everyday lives/people and places. This network is an ideal forum in which to discuss potential research themes within this framework, such as issues of contact and trade, the impact of movements and migrations, human-environment relationships and the ways these can be understood through material culture.   As well as discussing these issues within an academic context, we will use the network to build contacts beyond academia and extend the dialogue on the relevance of archaeology and heritage to a wider community. We believe this is particularly important in areas such as the Northwest of Sri Lanka (which will be the spatial focus for the Network), where post-conflict communities are working to find a sense of place and belonging.  Being able to network effectively with representatives from CSOs and NGOs that work locally means that the network will benefit from their ground-based knowledge and experience which will help shape approaches to understanding how archaeology and heritage could be important for communities, and support the creation of identity. This type of networking is also an excellent opportunity for non-academic groups to learn about what we do, and draw on it where useful to support and expand their own work. A good example of this from other contexts is work in London where psychologists have found that fine arts can be hugely helpful for recent refugees suffering trauma.    The network will hold two major meetings. The first in the UK to enable Sri Lankan participants to visit and experience venues that focus on everyday heritage of the more recent past and to meet heritage practitioners, teachers and academics. The second in Sri Lanka will extend the dialogue in an open forum meeting in Colombo and also spend time in the Nor",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.00763576431199908

In Chitwan and Dang districts forestry and fish-farming are male dominated sectors where decision-power and access to direct benefits are held by men. Traditional roles low education levels and lack of targeted services limit women?s opportunities in these sectors. Climate and non-climate hazards aggravate livelihood insecurity and especially women in the marginalized groups are in risk to fall beyond safety nets.The project enables women to seize a centric role in terms of decision-making and direct economic benefits in fish-farming and forest value-chains. Farmers organizations hold a crucial role in breaking discriminating structures and transforming production towards resilient pathways. The project engages 18 organizations which commit to non-discrimination provide targeted services for women and boost the presentation of their 1200 women members? interest. New policy mechanisms are established linking women producers with local governments? decision making. Local organizations engage their members and communities (5450 men and women) to embrace rights and responsibilities and to seize emerging opportunities in climate-smart production value-addition and bio-products.Women improve resilience of fish-farming and non-timber forest products NTFP value-chains as the farmers organizations promote risk mitigation and climate-smart practices.

Vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change is remarkable. Threatened species such as tigers and snow leopards are threatened by poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Rural people are dependent on the natural resources for their daily needs to provide food, fodder, energy and water. Moreover, climate change has exacerbated the threats to biodiversity and peoples livelihoods. Theres also now window of opportunity to facilitate conservation mainstreaming in new federal structure.##Geographically programme focuses to the far-western parts of Nepal which belong under the Terai Arc Landscape. Programme aims to improve the forest corridor cover and connectivity as well as support buffer zone conservation and management through community-based conservation and cooperation with district forest officers. Improvement of the livelihoods and wellbeing of the local communities is gained through developing income generating activities such as forest-based enterprises and by increasing access to low carbon energy. In addition, we increase conservation awareness and empower local youth to act for the environment. We also support local communities to adapt in climate change by developing ecosystem based adaptation solutions. Programme tackles illegal wildlife trade and poaching by supporting community-based anti-poaching groups. ##Expected achievements by 2021# Around 3,000 ha of degraded forest is under improved management and restoration# Community forest groups and their members are capacitated and empowered to manage forests# Sustainable forest management plans are prepared and implemented for degraded forest area# At least 3 green community based enterprises are established and strengthened# 5,000 plus youth and children are made aware of conservation issues and challenges##Beneficiaries: the local community forest user groups, women and youth groups, ethnic minority groups, forest workers and disadvantaged groups, local governments.##Implementor: WWF Nepal (www.wwfnepal.org)",Environmental policy and administrative management,Review,0.00663821259513497
2020006754,Creating Resilient Sustainable Microgrids through Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems,CREATING RESILIENT SUSTAINABLE MICROGRIDS THROUGH HYBRID RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEMS,"Universal access to affordable modern clean energy is goal 7 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs state that 'Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential.' In sub-Saharan Africa, more than 625 million people have no access to modern energy services. Most African countries - 42 in all - are net energy importers and fossil-fuel-fired plants account for 81% of total electricity generation, which is mostly in South Africa. Most large infrastructure projects are public investments financed by national budgets. The estimated cost of bringing Africa's energy infrastructure to modern standard is 93 billion USD/ year. There is a huge gap between energy supply and demand in Africa, and other developing countries, that successive efforts have failed to bridge. The envisioned holistic hybrid MGs will lead to a prototype model for the creation of sustainable and resilient distribution networks for off-grid locations. This approach has the potential to enable electrification of millions of households. Both Tanzania and Uganda are low income 'least developed' countries with a high level of rural poverty and very limited grid connectivity. The Republic of Congo is classed as a lower middle income country due to its mineral wealth, but has low grid connectivity away from cities and its research sector suffers from under-investment in research capacity building  This proposal focuses on energy distribution in off-grid communities with a population of around 4000 inhabitants, a size that has been recommended by our African project partners as being the practical optimum for implementation. The research has an integrated approach to ensure that the design of the system is maintainable, has good longevity with low cost, meets diverse community energy needs and is resilient to natural hazards. The overall goal is to enable the development of sustainable and resilient energy distribution grids in rural communities of the low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) Tanzania, Uganda and Republic of the Congo, where currently at most 10% of the rural population has access to electricity. We will achieve this by designing a scalable low-cost MG infrastructure based on a novel planning methodology that incorporates real-time operational strategies and sustainable generation flexibility at the system design stage to reduce the investment requirements and increase sustainability. The MG paradigm will ensure that the research outcomes are also applicable to communities with sporadic grid connections. Building on the existing partnership platform created by the PI's five year £1.2M Royal Society renewable energy capacity building project, the present grant will enable us to realise and experimentally validate a unique, integrated, design platform that incorporates electrical network requirements with",Research/scientific institutions,Review,0.00663056690245867

As part of the strategy implementation, the Embassy of Sweden in Nairobi shall contribute to the result: Better opportunities- particularly for women and young people- for productive employment with decent working conditions , and in this case, with linkages to resilience, environmental impact, climate change, natural disasters and conflict.This contribution is an inception-phase to support above mentioned results. The inception phase will include a thorough and in-depth Market System Development Analysis (MSDA), resulting in a well-thought through program document and proposal to the Embassy of Sweden for a 4-year Market System Development (MSD) program, addressing Productive Employment, Improved Livelihood & Resilience for Rural Youth in Kenya.The proposed intervention from Mercy Corps, Technoserve and Agora Global is a 10-month Inception Phase to design the program Resilience And Livelihood Improvement for Youth through Systems (RALIYS), a 4-year youth-targeted Market Systems Development (MSD) program that aligns with and directly contributes to the key priorities defined in the Swedish Development cooperation strategy with Kenya, 2016–2020. Alignment with national policies and strategies, including Kenya Vision 2030, Kenya Youth Development Policy (2018), Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Strategy - 2017-2026, and Green Economy Strategy and Implementation Plan (GESIP) 2016-2030, as well as with other programs and initiatives in the country, will be an important element of the design phase. The overarching goal of RALIYS is to increase incomes of poor and marginalised rural female and male youth (ages 18-35), and build their resilience to shocks and stresses in order to reduce their losses. RALIYS will achieve scale and sustainability by working with public and private sector market actors who have the capability and incentives to address the critical constraints that prevent rural youth from participating productively in key market systems.The Inception Phase will analyse rural youth, their context, and selected market systems, sectors, and value chains in the following five (tentative) counties – Isiolo, Marsabit, Samburu Tana River and Wajir.

2020007206,Satellite data for Weather Index Insurance-AgricuLtural EaRly warning system (SatWIN-ALERT),SATELLITE DATA FOR WEATHER INDEX INSURANCE-AGRICULTURAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (SATWIN-ALERT),"For the more than 200 million farmers in Africa who depend on rain-fed agriculture, drought is a matter of life and death. Their vulnerability is often aggravated by a lack of access to risk management tools such as insurance, which also limits their ability to take productive risks on their farms. Index insurance, where compensation is based on weather or area yield metrics, rather than on measured losses, is an affordable alternative to traditional insurance. However, index insurance will only increase resilience to climate shocks if the index insured fairly reflects the risk for both farmers and insurers.   Index design processes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, utilizing multiple data-sources and models. A certain degree of basis risk (where compensation doesn't match observed losses) is, however, inevitable as insurance is not designed to target every risk. Anticipating basis risk that ensues from the complexity in the relationship between meteorological drought (rainfall deficit) and agricultural drought (soil moisture deficit) is a key challenge for the agricultural insurance sector.   We propose a new system, SatWIN-ALERT, which can be deployed in real time to detect and predict basis risk events as they happen. As such, it could unlock in-season actions (such as increased monitoring), or allow timely post-season index assessment or action, enabling aid agencies and governments to anticipate basis risk events, and take action to support farmers who are facing uncompensated agricultural losses. In effect, the facility to predict pay outs and losses bridges the gap between post hoc index insurance and forecast-based finance. SatWIN-ALERT provides a means of combining the data issued by existing platforms into integrated assessments of droughts and subsequent compensation. As such, it can be integrated into well-established and trusted insurance design systems, such as the ARC risk viewer (ARV) or the IRI Social Network for Index Insurance Design (SNIID).   SatWIN-ALERT builds on existing state-of-the-art practices to take a sophisticated approach to basis risk management, allowing index insurance to play an improved role within climate risk management and development. We also bring together novel existing participatory and meteorological research to build systems that are suitable for operational use in ODA countries. To do this, we draw on fundamental research on monitoring of environmental conditions, and on recent improvements in forecasts - especially on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales, working with established partners to bring results to hundreds of thousands of farmers. We will focus on countries identified as important to our partners, specifically Malawi for our participatory research, plus Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Zambia and Ethiopia (amongst others) for our basis risk case studies.  In summary, the proposed project will develop a novel operational system (SatWIN-ALERT), which empowers farmers to benefit from robust",Environmental research,Yes,0.00652558030560613

Waste is culturally seen 'not in my backyard (NIMBY)' issue. The mindset of considering waste as a 'please in my backyard (PIMBY) philosophy is at its infancy, if exists at all. Most people do not know, hence undervalue, the energy, food production and soil enrichment potential of waste. They also are unaware of the health danger of invisible enemies such as drinking water and food contamination from poorly managed waste.   There is a critical need to show that small scale, off-grid bioenergy systems do work, that they are sustainable and are capable of delivering solutions to waste management, power generation, food and soil security and improve people's health and well-being in peri-urban/informal and rural communities. The demonstrator pilots will encompass the collection of waste materials, their sustained processing through AD and the realisation of product values. They will be integrated into 2 distinct community-based settings: a small, domestic system associated with a community school in Accra, Ghana and a larger university campus-based activity in UniBen, Nigeria. Evidence from the demonstration pilots will enable potential investors and policy makers in both Nigeria and Ghana to have the technical and social evidence and confidence that these systems can work in situ beyond the laboratory. They represent the first and vital step for our partner organisations (CGE Nigeria, UNiBen, CSIR and LU Ghana) to take a lead in commercially growing business opportunities through entrepreneurial leadership in this domain.  The ambition, objectives and workplan for ACTUATE emerge from Lancaster's deep engagement with researchers and research users in sub-Saharan Africa through several GCRF-funded research and capacity-building projects. Africa is a strategic priority for Lancaster which is currently the only UK University to have a campus on the continent. In addition to our long-standing partnership building in Ghana and Nigeria, Lancaster University has grown national leadership in eco-innovation - innovation supporting both business growth and the environment.

Biopharmaceuticals are protein drugs that are used to treat an increasingly wide range of serious diseases, to the extent that half of all new drugs are predicted to be biopharmaceuticals by 2020. They are usually produced in bacterial or animal cells, which makes them difficult to make and far too expensive for the vast majority of patients in developing countries. In Thailand, fewer than 2% of patients have access to anti-cancer biopharmaceuticals that are routinely used in the UK, and which are on the World Health Organisation's list of 'minimum medicine needs for a basic health-care system'. Cancer rates in Thailand are high and rising, so there is a profound need for these medicines.   Animal vaccines are required to combat infections in livestock, which is a growing problem in Thailand and other countries due to the increasing demands of growing populations. Many imported vaccines do not work well because they were raised against strains that are simply too different. Thailand and other developing countries suffer massive losses in livestock every year, with some outbreaks leading to 90% loss rates.  Countries such as Thailand can only address these problems by producing the biopharmaceuticals themselves, at much lower costs, and by formulating vaccines that are matched to circulating viral strains. Progress in both areas requires large scale facilities for recombinant protein production, usually in E. coli or mammalian cells. This is a highly complex area and most developing countries do not have this capacity - hence they need to import the products. To address this problem the Thai government has established a purpose-built National Biopharmaceutical Facility (NBF), built in 2014 and fully equipped for bacterial/ animal cell systems and product formulation. It has also developed a substantial animal vaccine research group.   The UK has world-class expertise in this area of 'bioprocessing' and this project aims to apply this expertise, initially in Thailand and later elsewhere, to develop the NBF into a state of the art facility that can make both biopharmaceuticals and vaccine antigens. The UK team includes experts in every step of the production chain, including design of expression system, expression of proteins at high levels, large scale cultivation, product extraction / purification, and product 'analysis'. The latter area is crucially important, any drugs licensed for human use have to pass extremely stringent quality tests that involve detailed analysis of the final protein product.  During the project a group of the UK applicants will work closely with the Thai team to transfer their capabilities to the Thai centres and build up production capacity. This will be aided by seconding the UK researchers to Thailand for long periods, and visits by the Thai",Education policy and administrative management,Review,0.00472873309627175

We will be working with communities facing pressures related to global challenges of poverty, health access, water supply and climate change. Our focus is on the strategic GCRF challenge of education and, specifically, sharing expertise in making primary and secondary education relevant to the socioscientific issues faced by communities in Mexico and South America. Initially we will convene work in Mexico and focus on the educational responses required to support communities in preparing for and preventing crises related to environmental and health pressures brought about by water shortage and water contamination. In Mexico and South America such issues are complex and related to poverty and access to services. Our approach is to bring together interdisciplinary expertise with the aim of proposing an educational response relevant to the local and specific conditions of those communities and schools. Our principled belief is that a normative sharing of 'best practice' or 'what works' (perhaps still the predominant approach) will inevitably fail to meet the specific needs of communities facing different challenges in different contexts. Our Network will begin with particular issues in identified communities and grow in a modular manner, incorporating other groups and other challenges and sharing the diversity of approaches needed to bring education close to lived issues. The Network will act as a repository for skills and expertise in which we stay close to community concerns, learning with and through those academics and non-academics who have experience and connections in the communities involved.

The viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical regions, including many low-income countries. Most infected individuals recover, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months or even years, and effects of outbreaks on working communities are devastating.Currently no antiviral therapies or vaccines have been approved for any alphavirus infection. In recent research, we showed that viral RNA replication is entirely dependent on interaction with the cellular protein G3BP. We propose to form a collaborative network to use structure-based methods to design compounds which would block viral interaction with G3BP, thus blocking replication of chikungunya virus and the others in the alphavirus group. We will test a number of compounds for antiviral activity, with the best performing compounds being used as templates to design improvements in a second generation of compounds. We will organise a number of meetings at each location and we will apply for further funds to expand our network in future years.Anti-alphaviral compounds would be of enormous benefit for global health, especially in regions of low or low-to-middle income.

For these reasons, water security is considered one of the top global risks to development. Water security is also fundamental to attaining many of the Sustainable Development Goals, being a constraint on meeting a range of challenges including food security, access to clean water, and resilience to hydrological hazards. At the same time, attaining food security is a priority of national policy in SSA countries and is a key building block of development.   The reasons for insufficient progress in attaining water and food security are complex, but requires fine-scale, locally relevant research and solutions that are best developed and tested by local researchers and practitioners. Although capacity to carry out research in this area in SSA countries is variable, there are a number of fundamental gaps in the required skills and resources. To address these, our project will develop and implement a comprehensive and flexible programme of activities aimed at strengthening research capacity between the UK and SSA countries while addressing the grand challenges around water and food security. We will develop a pipeline of activities that is guided by a set of key research questions and implemented in the context of a collaborative network of researchers and practitioners that can sustain and propagate capacity and knowledge more broadly.   Our focus is on three countries in SSA: Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana. These are representative of different geographical, climate, socio-economic, cultural and institutional settings and challenges that will allow for comparative research and exchange of ideas, and the development of a richer collaborative network. These countries are also where we have complementary, ongoing university-level research projects and collaborations focused on various aspects of water/food security with institutions at different levels of capacity development. The programme of capacity building activities will be tailored to each institution and its goals through a process of co-evaluation of needs, co-development of activities and co-implementation, including south-south capacity building and knowledge exchange.",Education policy and administrative management,Review,0.0043617463670671

By controlling animal diseases, negative impact on economic development, food security and livelihoods can be mitigated. For many important animal diseases the epidemiology is well understood, but despite that, effective control is not achieved. It is becoming evident that to control diseases, sociocultural, economic and political dimensions are as important as veterinary knowledge.African swine fever (ASF), is a severe and fatal infectious disease of pigs, with great socio-economic impact on rural communities in Uganda. ASF has been known and studied for almost 100 years, but is still uncontrolled in most areas.Using multidisciplinary participatory methods, the project will investigate reasons for farmers' responses to disease, such as social pressures, poverty-related constraints, and lack of health and veterinary infrastructure. The feasibility of sustainable implementation of control interventions at all levels in the value chain will be investigated, and the effect of stakeholder participation on the processes evaluated. The project seeks to enable more effective policies for disease control, including promotion of  control interventions that are feasible to implement  within the particular local context.

Description: This proposal will investigate the mechanism of cell-to-cell transmission and spread of flaviviruses using Dengue and Zika as model systems. We will therefore address a longstanding debate on how they exit from infected cells, and preferentially spread into specific cell types. Dengue and Zika are the two most prevalent flaviviruses worldwide, sharing significant overlap in their genome architecture and biology. Dengue infects > 50 million people annually, causing severe pathologies. Zika too has emerged as a global threat with recent outbreaks linked to serious neuro-developmental complications in children and Guillain Barré syndrome in adults. No vaccines or therapeutics exist for these viruses, and our current understanding on mechanisms of their transmission and spread is severely limited. Viral infections spread by overcoming multiple barriers to move from cell to cell. Viral progenies can move across extracellular space either as free particles via fluid phase diffusion, within vesicles, or by cell-cell contacts. To understand transmission, we will therefore address: (i) characteristics of the extracellular virus populations, (ii) whether multiple transmission routes exist (iii) whether the viral envelope is the primary determinant of transmissibility. This proposal builds on our previously published and ongoing studies on viral manipulation of autophagy for assembly and spread.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.00386181147769094

2018067743A,IMF Financial Sector Stability Fund,IMF FINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY FUND,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Sector Stability Fund is a Fund for capacity-building in financial stability, integration and advancement in low-and middle-income countries.  Financial inclusion and financial stability are two closely interrelated concepts that both links to the financing for development agenda and the SDG targets. The G-20 has also highlighted the importance of both financial inclusion (Maya Declaration and the global partnership for financial integration) and the strengthening of financial stability (Council for financial stability (Financial Stability Board)), Basel III implementation and other regulatory reforms). At the global level, Sida supports a number of programmes that focus on financial integration but only a few focus on financial stability. Toronto Center and Sida's technical assistance programs with Sweden's Riksbank are two examples. Both of these two have an emphasis on capacity-building of government institutions of all central banks and its features.The IMF's Fund differs from these in that the capacity building the Fund is carrying out has direct links with the IMF's two other main mandates of surveillance and lending and is based on a holistic approach throughout the financial sector. FSSF's connection to the IMF's entirety creates an added value, of course, that there is a direct link to the management of financial crises and resistance to reduce the occurrence of crises, mitigate the impact of these.   The program is based on two main modules: -Module for financial sector statistics that help to provide decision makers with the statistical basis for the analysis of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial sector as well as the interconnection between sectors of the economy and the rest of the world.  -Module for financial sector reforms that will establish diagnostic baseline revisions, highlighting key weaknesses in the financial systems and institutional capacity as well as establish a prioritized action plan for financial sector reforms.       Similar to all IMF capacity development programs, the program is demand-driven, implemented by experienced internal experts and based on the IMF's long history of global commitment in this area. Genuine ownership is a prerequisite to be effective and achieve long-term sustainable results. The close connection to the IMF's surveillance and lending mandates also creates a unique opportunity for long-term sustainable results.",Public sector policy and administrative management,Review,0.00197750865481794

While there is no direct correlation between the income level and the possibility of being infected by the dengue virus, the economic impact on the poor is much larger since the funds spent by households below the poverty-line for the treatment of dengue amounts to 93.7% of their monthly per capita income even though free health care is available in Sri Lanka.The main vectors species of the Dengue and Zika viruses are mosquitoes that breed in very slow-flowing or standing water pools. It is important to reduce and control such breeding grounds to contain the spread of the diseases. We propose to use drones, unmanned micro aerial vehicles (UAV), to locate mosquito breeding grounds. UAVs equipped with cameras, accelerometers and other sensors can provide close-range aerial-inspection-capabilities. Using drones is a low-cost and hence sustainable solution. The main scientific challenges are to conceive visual-based, active sensing functionality to allow drones autonomously locate the relevant sites with little to no human intervention. Further, drones must be enabled to maneuver in confined areas to carry out the required tasks in built-up urban environments. Lastly, we must adaptively coordinate the operation of multiple drones to balance the application load among available resources, particularly with respect to the limited battery lifetime.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.00195261102635413

The team is composed of PI Pahl and poet Gloria Kiconco, based in Kampala, Uganda. Kiconco is a published poet and zine maker who has previously run zine workshops for women. Together with artist Charity Atukunda she will work with two organisations to create zine-making workshops. Each workshop will last for 4 days. There will be three workshops in total, two in partnership with the organisations and one in order to prepare for the exhibition. The resulting zines will be displayed in a travelling library, originating in Kampala and disseminated via the African Poetry Fund to a library in Mombasa, and poetry library networks in the UK via the newly created Manchester Poetry Library. The organisation, 'StrongMinds' argues on its website that depression is one of the most serious challenges facing African women. Women suffering from depression have very little support (https://strongminds.org/the-need/). Life is particularly hard for those on the margins and women and girls face challenges if they are considered 'outsiders' in any sense of the word. This project draws on the idea of the zine, as a form that can be adapted and autonomously used by individuals to express themselves. Zines can be about anything, in this project they will combine poetry and art to be formed in workshops with skilled facilitators Kiconco and Atukunda. Equipping women with life writing and expression skills is a key part of this project. Drawing Artvism's vision that women in particular need writing skills to equip them in life, the project will place creation and autonomy at the heart of its vision. Our vision is to do that in collaboration with these organisations dedicated to supporting women. The project team includes an evaluator, Lisa Damon, who has experience of working with refugee groups as a researcher, and is currently a doctoral student at the University of Makerere. Gloria Kiconco is the lead in Kampala. She is a published poet, who works closely with arts organisations to realise her zines, which are a mix of poetry and art. She has previously been part of the AHRC funded project on New Enhancements to Enhance Artists' Livelihood in East Africa (PI Andrew Burton). Charity Atukunda is a visual artist who worked with PI Pahl on the AHRC funded 'Belonging and Learning' project, which worked with young refugees in Kampala to create art that would directly speak to policy-makers. The team will be led by PI Pahl, drawing on her experience of co-production, and includes Co-Investigator Su Corcoran, who has developed strong links with organisations within Kampala through the 'Belonging and Learning' project, and researcher McMillan, a poet, and Kratz, who is working in the field of poetry libraries.

2018290914,Avian influenza in Bangladesh: the role of wild waterfowl in disease transmission,AVIAN INFLUENZA IN BANGLADESH: THE ROLE OF WILD WATERFOWL IN DISEASE TRANSMISSION,"Avian influenza is a devastating disease for poultry caused by highly-pathogenic influenza A viruses. Since the emergence of H5N1 in 1999, this virus and later progeny viruses (such as H5N6, H5N8) have become endemic in parts of Asia, with  outbreaks in poultry and few, but highly lethal, infections in humans. Highly pathogenic viruses are related to low pathogenic viruses that circulate naturally among wild waterfowl, and it is evident that highly pathogenic viruses can be maintained in the wild bird reservoir. And important question to ask is to which extent the interface between migratory waterfowl and poultry contributes to disease persistence. We propose to combine movement ecology of waterfowl with disease epidemiology of avian influenza viruses to investigate transmission of a highly contagious and lethal poultry disease at the wildlife/domestic animal interface in rural areas of Bangladesh. Poultry, both ducks and chickens, is an essential product in agriculture in Bangladesh, for subsistence farmers and for the expanding poultry industry. Outbreaks are devastating for individual farmers, but also has ramifications for trade. We will use the development in animal tracking to generate individual-based movement data of birds, ranging from smaller movements during non-breeding times to long distance migrations. The resulting tracks will inform spatial-epidemiological models to quantify persistence/transmission of avian influenza viruses at regional and flyway scales.",Infectious disease control,Review,0.0015343859558925

Grupo Supervielle a été fondé en 1887 . Ce conglomérat financier a su maîtriser sa croissance tout en mettant en place une gestion prudente de ses risques, ce qui lui a permis de faire face aux crises survenues dans les années 2000. Avec un total bilan de 4,9 Mds USD (et une part de marché de 2,6%), Banco Supervielle est la onzième banque du système parmi les 62 banques argentines, et la quatrième banque privée nationale. La Banque a montré sa capacité à se positionner sur des segments et sous-segments dans lesquels elle a développé des produits et un service adaptés pour se différencier et en devenir le leader (leasing, modèle d'attention à sa clientèle senior pour le règlement des retraites). Banco Supervielle est également le leader de marché dans la province de San Luis. Cette opération est réalisée dans le cadre de la facilité de cofinancement (Friendship Facility). Le FMO, arrangeur du financement, et Proparco mettent ainsi à disposition de Banco Supervielle une ligne de crédit senior d'un montant total de 80 MUSD (40 MUSD chacun). Cette ligne de crédit sera intégralement dédiée au financement des PME locales qui ont besoin de ressources longues pour accompagner leur croissance. Le financement de Proparco devrait ainsi bénéficier la clientèle PME de la banque et soutenir la création ou le maintien de plus de 1 700 emplois parmi les clients de Banco Supervielle. Avec plus de 130 ans de présence sur le marché argentin, Banco Supervielle emploie également  près de 5320 employés dont un peu moins de la moitié sont des femmes (49%). Le nouveau financement permettra de soutenir la croissance de l'activité de la Banque, laquelle pourrait créer près de 650 emplois additionnels, dont 50% de femmes, dans les cinq prochaines années. Au total, ce projet devrait ainsi soutenir la création ou le maintien de près de 7 700 emplois en Argentine.",Formal sector financial intermediaries,Review,0.00116838398389518
