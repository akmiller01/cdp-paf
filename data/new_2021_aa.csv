2021002417,Satellite data for Weather Index Insurance-AgricuLtural EaRly warning system (SatWIN-ALERT),SATELLITE DATA FOR WEATHER INDEX INSURANCE-AGRICULTURAL EARLY WARNING SYSTEM (SATWIN-ALERT),"For the more than 200 million farmers in Africa who depend on rain-fed agriculture, drought is a matter of life and death. Their vulnerability is often aggravated by a lack of access to risk management tools such as insurance, which also limits their ability to take productive risks on their farms. Index insurance, where compensation is based on weather or area yield metrics, rather than on measured losses, is an affordable alternative to traditional insurance. However, index insurance will only increase resilience to climate shocks if the index insured fairly reflects the risk for both farmers and insurers.   Index design processes are becoming increasingly sophisticated, utilizing multiple data-sources and models. A certain degree of basis risk (where compensation doesn't match observed losses) is, however, inevitable as insurance is not designed to target every risk. Anticipating basis risk that ensues from the complexity in the relationship between meteorological drought (rainfall deficit) and agricultural drought (soil moisture deficit) is a key challenge for the agricultural insurance sector.   We propose a new system, SatWIN-ALERT, which can be deployed in real time to detect and predict basis risk events as they happen. As such, it could unlock in-season actions (such as increased monitoring), or allow timely post-season index assessment or action, enabling aid agencies and governments to anticipate basis risk events, and take action to support farmers who are facing uncompensated agricultural losses. In effect, the facility to predict pay outs and losses bridges the gap between post hoc index insurance and forecast-based finance. SatWIN-ALERT provides a means of combining the data issued by existing platforms into integrated assessments of droughts and subsequent compensation. As such, it can be integrated into well-established and trusted insurance design systems, such as the ARC risk viewer (ARV) or the IRI Social Network for Index Insurance Design (SNIID).   SatWIN-ALERT builds on existing state-of-the-art practices to take a sophisticated approach to basis risk management, allowing index insurance to play an improved role within climate risk management and development. We also bring together novel existing participatory and meteorological research to build systems that are suitable for operational use in ODA countries. To do this, we draw on fundamental research on monitoring of environmental conditions, and on recent improvements in forecasts - especially on sub-seasonal to seasonal time scales, working with established partners to bring results to hundreds of thousands of farmers. We will focus on countries identified as important to our partners, specifically Malawi for our participatory research, plus Nigeria, Senegal, Malawi, Zambia and Ethiopia (amongst others) for our basis risk case studies.  In summary, the proposed project will develop a novel operational system (SatWIN-ALERT), which empowers farmers to benefit from robust",Environmental research,Review,0.0177364163100719

Through this support, FAO will focus on the phases 3-5 in the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) i.e. (3) Crisis, (4) Emergency and (5) Catastrophe/Famine. FAO s new strategic framework 2022-2030 places the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at the centre of its operations. In terms of programme priority areas related to humanitarian interventions, FAO will focus on agriculture and food emergencies in countries facing, or at risk of acute food insecurity, by providing urgent livelihood and nutrition assistance. The strategic framework states that by 2023 FAO aims to assist 60 million people annually with emergency and resilience interventions, and through investments in anticipatory action that will reduce humanitarian needs in the future. This is an ambitious increase from the 35 million target in 2019. The focus on both acute food security and livelihoods with positive spill-over effects on household and community resilience in combination with FAO's leading technical expertise in agriculture and its focus on Anticipatory Action, makes FAO a valuable strategic humanitarian partner to Sida.Sida will in 2022 allocate 124 million SEK to FAO's emergency interventions in six countries: Afghanistan, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Madagascar and Somalia. This support also includes unallocated funds to emerging and deteriorating humanitarian situations through the Special Fund for Emergency and Rehabilitation Activities (SFERA) as well as a method development support to strengthening countries' capacities for risk-informed localized humanitarian responses.",Relief co-ordination and support services,Review,0.000493281579110771
2021003600,Omics analysis of density-dependent disease resistance in a major crop pest,OMICS ANALYSIS OF DENSITY-DEPENDENT DISEASE RESISTANCE IN A MAJOR CROP PEST,"Pathogens are a ubiquitous threat to all living organisms, and a wide range of defense mechanisms have evolved to manage this threat. One way for an individual to prime its immune defense is to monitor the environment for cues of an infection threat and invest in immunity accordingly. The most obvious cue from the environment is previous exposure to pathogens. Nevertheless, exposure to a pathogen cue is itself dangerous to a potential host and a safer alternative is for individuals to respond to sensory cues that predict an elevated risk of infection before exposure. These are termed prophylactic or anticipatory defences. Reduced susceptibility to parasitic infection in individuals exposed to cues associated with high population density is known as Density-Dependent Prophylaxis (DDP), a putative adaptive response to the increased threat from parasites transmitted in a positively density-dependent manner. In the twenty years since the DDP phenomenon was first proposed, it has been characterised in a wide range of 20+ insect species, including Spodoptera caterpillars, but the molecular mechanism underpinning DDP has yet to be characterised, and this is the focus of my proposal.Spodoptera exempta is a major pest of cereal crops and pastureland throughout sub-Saharan Africa, causing serious food shortage. It expresses both phase polyphenism (different phenotypes expressed in different environments) and density-dependent prophylaxis, to a greater extent than any other lepidopteran insect. Spodoptera exempta nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpexNPV) is a dsDNA baculovirus that is host-specific to S. exempta. I will use the Spodoptera-SpexNPV host-virus system, using a series of molecular and other methods, including RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, RNAi and pathogen biological analysis, to study the differential responses for *constitutively* expressed genes and pathogen resistance in solitary and gregarious larvae. To characterise differential responses for genes that are *induced* in response to baculovirus challenge and differential virus resistance in â€˜primedâ€™ solitary and gregarious larvae. Furthermore, the key immune genes underpinning density-dependent baculovirus resistance will be identified.The results of this study may provide a novel opportunity to manage a range of important lepidopteran crop pests.",Multisector education/training,Review,0.000366883061360568
